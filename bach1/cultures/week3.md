##### People on the Pacific Rim have a FIXATION on Asian Values.
* Breakdown of **Asian values** 
	* The Liberal West has a fixation on Asian values as a cheap, quick way to success, especially within the context of prioritising PUBLIC good by giving up PRIVATE interests.
	* ORIENTALISM
		* *Edward Said*: The West's conception of 'Asia' as being a single entity that has a **SHARED SET** of Cultural practices
			* "Asian values"
	* TECHNO-ORIENTALISM
		 * Imaging that the 'Asia-Pacific' is comprised of technologically advanced societies with highly efficient citizens, contributing to Asian countries' technical success
   * WEST often **FIXATES ON** their warped perception of ASIAN VALUES (efficiency, effectiveness), which are perceived to occur by sacrificing PRIVATE freedoms for PUBLIC good.
   * NEOLIBERALISM
	   * Liberal ideology where the State should **encourage market participation** and **defend PRIVATE property ownership**, such that there are only PRIVATES and no PUBLIC to speak of.
		* *TLDR*: Only purpose of the PUBLIC is to defend PRIVATE interests
		* MULTICULTURALISM (multiple cultures can coexist together without actual proper integration) is thus a *Liberal ideology*, and it goes hand-in-hand with NEOLIBERALISM
