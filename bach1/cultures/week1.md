# Big group discussion

1. *Differences* 
    * `Die Hard`: More individualist  
    * `Pacific Rim`: More collectivist
2. Differences in the movies are product of their time, difference in `historical moment`. 
    * `Die Hard`: Post-WW2 Post-Cold war era of films && potrayal of America
    * `Pacific Rim`: There is value in a collective consciousness that ultimately saves the day in geographical Pacific Rim
3. The geographical Pacific Rim and the "dream" of collective cooperation and peace. --> How realistic is it? 
4. The issues with the dream of liberalism. 
5. The way Publics and Privates interact with each other, are the ratios equal? 
6. How each movie deals with the anxiety of collective work.
