## Definitions

* `Epistemology`: how we know what we know, usually in a world

* `World`: epistemological reality that structures our imagination of what is real, *a reality that feels tangible*

* `Culture`: practices we do to make an imagined world (an epistemology) into a reality that everyone can experience

* `Modern culture`: the way we do things in a world that has been made “new” through “Western” legacies of colonization (including Asia and “Pacific Rim”)

* `Publics`: common worlds we make together

* `Privates`: individual units, institutions, and spaces we mark off for self-interest and survival

* `Institutions`: some kind of organized corporate or networked set of structures that allows people to make a more effective impact on the worlds they are making *e.g. states, unis, banks, firms, non-profit orgs, clubs, churches, activist collectives* --> **formalise an otherwise informal activity**

* [`Pacific Rim`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Rim): countries on the rim of the Pacific Ocean *(but check link for exact countries)*
