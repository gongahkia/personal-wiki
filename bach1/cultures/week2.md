* The role of the Asian diaspora and their respective narratives within the American cultural hegemony

## Readings

### 1. `The Pacific Proving Grounds and the Proliferation of Settler Environmentalism`



### 2. `TRANSPACIFIC NOIR, DYING COLONIALISM`

JINAH KIM claims that the Pacific Rim can be read as a Noir story.

* Noir: genre that digs below the surface of what seems to be a wholesome reality to reveal a greedy and violent underground 
    * PUBLIC image hides a festering PRIVATE reality
* PUBLIC image of America as a force for good and this bastion of democracy that hides the PRIVATE reality of selfish greed and back-stabbing self-interest.

### 3. `When and Where I Enter`

* Assuming that we as Asians are trapped in the NOIR narrative that American History is putting up especially in the Transpacific, **how then should we live?**
* Observe how WESTERN VALUES play out in ASIA and the Pacific Rim
* Characterisation of Asia as the 'other', with America's founding father treating Asia as a place to get cool stuff
    * Inevitably creates the understanding that America treats Asia as an oriental place to 'get cool stuff', including people
* MANIFEST DESTINY
    * Spread of Christianity
    * Using Christianity to bolster your Western Imperalist message
    * American History
        * Matthew Perry in Tokyo Bay
        * Unequal treaties in Opium Wars
    * We see that repeatedly, Asian powers are so oppresed by Western powers that they take a HARD LEFT and move toward facist, nationalistic governments in an attempt to get stronger and move away from liberalism

**So...**

Asians so deeply affected can claim this American Pacific History, not forgetting their roots, but absorbing the good of American ideals (Capitalism, Justice and Democracy) and move forward with their story.
* Moving forward from Trauma and not being stuck in it by absorbing the history as a part of ourselves

### 4. `Why Karen Carpenter Matters - Made in America`

* In the 1970s, large proportion of Karen Carpenters fanbase was from Asia
* Karen and Richard Carpenter created a gleaming image of America in the Phillipines
    * **NOIR story**, where Karen and Richard project a wholesome public image with loads of skeletons in their own closets
        * Karen was into drugs and eating disorders
        * Richard was a controlling, ego-driven asshole
* **Karen Carpenter of the Phillipines**
    * Their image took on a life on their own in the Phillipines
    * The AMERICA that the 1970s Asian generation dreamed about *(an impression taken from the presentation of the pristine American dream in media)* was the Asian conception of the American dream, making it their own
        * America is in the Heart (Carlos Bulosan)
