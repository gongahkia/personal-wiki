# Summary of Week 1 readings

## 1. `McMahon 2013 (Chapter 19)`

* Notion that each person inherently **deserves** happiness, and that it should be an IDEAL GOAL to attain is a relatively *recent one* since the 18th century.

### Greeks on happiness

#### Croesus and Solon

* **Croesus**, king of Lydia is overcome by the longing to be the happiest man in the world. 
* **Solon**, lawgiver of Athens disagrees with Croesus, telling him "divine is altogether jealous and prone to trouble us", "there is much to see that one would rather not see and much to suffer likewise".
Croesus dismissed Solon, and subsequently is handed divine retribution leading to his death at his funeral pyre, exclaiming "noone who lives is happy".

> The relentless pursuit of happiness threatens always to subvert itself.

#### Aristotle 

* **Aristotle**: "The more (a happy man) has every virture and the happier he is, the more pain he will feel at the prospect of death. For this sort of person, more than anyone, finds it worth while to be alive, and is knowingly deprived of the greatest goods, and this is painful. As the happiness of the happy man increases, so does his suffering at its loss."

> Like the Stoics, Aristotle recommended the virtuous man look death in the eye, grin and bear it.

### Christians on happiness

* Gospel of Matthew, the Beatitudes, Christ's words to his disciples before He leaves them all point to the central idea that Christian happiness is not rooted in physical circumstances but in ultimate lasting joy found outside one's propserity.

* Reassertion of the wisdom of the tragic tradition, "no man is happy until he is dead". Christians only attain true peace, joy and happiness in paradise with their Saviour and Lord in Heaven.

#### Augustine

* **Augustine**: imagined the pursuit of happiness as a form of punishment, a continual, nagging reminder of our banishment from the Garden of Eden and the conse- quent human inability to live contentedly without God’s grace. According to this perspec- tive, every time we long for happiness, we remind ourselves of our unworthiness and inability to attain it on our own, a vicious cycle whose necessary byproduct was guilt.

### Enlightenment on happiness

#### Voltaire

* **Voltaire**: For freed to think of happiness as something other than the superior striving of the happy few, men and women granted happiness on earth the privileged place they had once afforded to happiness hereafter. “Paradise is where I am,” Voltaire declared with his characteristically provocative wit in the first line of his 1736 poem “Le Mondain”.

> It is no exaggeration to say that this very same revolutionary promise—to remake human beings and their world in the service of happiness—lies behind every one of the terrible experiments in social engineering that have brought such misery to the post-Enlightenment world. The terrible history of these ventures is well known to us today. And perhaps, in the West at least, we can feel some confidence that this knowledge will help guard against simi- lar experiments in the immediate future. To force human beings to be happy, it now seems clear, is no more practicable than to force them to be free.

* In the end, the enlightenment's manifestation of a society of forced happiness upon all peoples resulted in more bloodshed and despair.

### Conclusion

* When Voltaire’s hero, Candide, returns from circling the globe, wiser but no more happy than when he began, he concludes simply that “we must cultivate our garden.” Those seeking happiness—or something like it—in the twenty-first century, could do worse than to take up the hoe.
