# Week 1

```python
print(4 % 20) # --- when numerator is larger than denominator, the quotient will be the remainder returned by modulo operator

# Can use the multiplication operator in conjunction with a string to repeatedly print the same string
yes = 'no'
print(f"shit and also {yes * 10}")
```
