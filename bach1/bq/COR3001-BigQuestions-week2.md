# Summary of Week 2 readings

## 0. `Gratitude Journal`

* Thankfulness for the past allows us to look to the future with a happy outset
* Catharsis 
* Seeing how things CHANGE (not necesarily "improve")

## 1. `Feeling Good (pg 14- 25)` by Hurka Thomas

* Psychological Hedonism gets it backward, in fact what happens is you want something to occur first, and then derive pleasure from that thing occurring.
    * *As Butler said, we have desires for things outside us just as things outside us, and we often wouldnâ€™t get the pleasures we do without having those desires.*
* Concept that natural selection would favour those who have INSTINCTUAL desire to promote altrusitic behaviour, and pleasure arrives as a by-product after the act, instead of pleasure being the main arbiter by which we make our decisions.
* Types of pleasure
    1. simple pleasures that are discrete items in your consciousness
    2. simple pleasures that pervade your consciousness like a good mood
    3. complex pleasures that revolve around a particular object, like a friend's promotion or your favourite team winning
    4. complex pleasures that revolve around a more extended object, like your whole life

## 2. `The Experience Machine (pg 42-45)` by Robert Noczi
* What else could matter to us, other than how our lives feel from the inside?
* What is most disturbing about them *(these machines, experience machine, transformation machine, change machine)* is their living of our lives for us.
* Solipsism
    * There is an intangible quality that physical experience has, tying the body and soul together.

## 3. `Higher and Lower Pleasures` by Singer P

* *Utilitarianism:* Pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure as the prevention of pain.
* Concept of enjoying inferior pleasures due to men's proclivity to latch on to the "nearest" pleasure, not necesarily the one that would give them the greatest satisfaction

# Lecture

## Ideas

1. DESCRIPTIVE words vs EVALUATIVE words
2. How do we assign terms 'good' and 'bad' on an activity we do?
    1. Morality
        * Personal conviction
            * Religious Doctrine or Dogma
        * Societal expectations
        * Self-referencing virture
            * Secular philosophy
                * Stoicism
    2. Utility
        * Goal attainment, personal development
    * **Normative position** is diamterically opposed to **Positive assesment**
3. Do any worldviews bear the *assumptions of moral binaries* in their theology or doctrine?
4. WELL-BEING as opposed to happiness as being our main end good
    * Well-being of Family
    * Well-being of Friends
    * Religion, Person of Christ
5. INTRINSIC vs INSTRUMENTAL goods
    * **Instrumental good**: Good by extension / proxy, they are a means to further good
    * **Intrinsic good**: Good for you in a basic, direct way, a path to maximise your well-being

## Theories of well-being

Filtering the concept of well-being through different worldviews and frameworks.

* Most frameworks are insufficient in completely representing reality.

### 1. HEDONISM

* Proposed by Jeremy Bentham
* Intrinsic good is defined as **MORE PLEASURE**
* Intrinsic bad is defined as **MORE PAIN**
* **Pleasure** is evaluated from the *FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE*, and is SUBJECTIVE
    * *Utilitarianism:*
        * Pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure as the prevention of pain.  
* **Popular Hedonism vs Philosophical Hedonism**
    * Popular Hedonism
        * Often focuses in on Sensual Indulgence, bodily pleasure and pan
    * Philosphical Hedonism
        * This form of Hedonism is concerned with all varities of pleasure and pain.
        * There are different kinds of pleasures, Higher and Lower pleasures.
            * Higher pleasures: What everyone SHOULD strive to attain
            * Lower pleasures: Base pleasures, what animals will choose

    * Pyschological Hedonism
        * All human action is ultimately driven by desire for pleasure and the avoidance of pain.

#### Ok punk, then explain this!

1. Ascetics
    * Forgo pleasure for the sake of spiritual purity
    * FORGOES BODILY pleasure to gain EMOTIONAL pleasure like tranquality
2. Masochists
    * Seek pain and appear to enjoy it
    * SEEKS BODILY pain to gain EMOTIONAL and AESTHETIC pleasure
3. Cannot explain **altrusitic self-sacrifice**.
4. Overcomplicates our mental life with seemingly absent reasoning.
5. Does not fit the contemporary biological picture of animal motivation.
6. **False pleasures** are still pleasures
    * Hedonism cannot fully account for the taking of false pleasure

### 2. DESIRE FULFILMENT

* Intrinsic good is **desires being fulfilled**.
* Intrinsic bad is **desires going unfulfilled**.
* Desire being *fulfilled* is evaluated from the *THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE*, a relatively OBJECTIVE evaluation
* Desire being *fulfilled* has intrinsic value rather than the pleasure one might get from thinking it has been fulfilled.
* Accounts for the philosophical conundrums brought about by the experience machine

#### Oke, then explain this!

* Supressed desires cannot entirely be accounted for
* Misinformed desires that results from a lack of outcome thinking 
* Adaptive preferences: lowering one's desires due to self-calibrating for your self-estimated potential
* Inauthentic preferences as a result of societal indoctrination and influences

### 3. OBJECTIVE LIST THEORY

* Intrinsic good is **an objective list** that we should follow, even if we don't desire them or take pleasure in them.
* Intrinsic bad is **an objective list** that we should reject, even if we desire them or take pleasure in them.
* Commonly seen in Religious doctrines.
* Determining whether something is objectively good is taken from the *THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE* a relatively OBJECTIVE evaluation

#### Huh, then this one how to say?

* Subjectivity of the Objective List
    * There are multiple lists, seen in the variance of multiple world religions.
    * Lists created by fallible humans will inevitably muddy the separation between intrinsic and instrumental goods.
