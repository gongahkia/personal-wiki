# Summary of Week 2 readings

## 1. `Feeling Good (pg 14- 25)` by Hurka Thomas

* Psychological Hedonism gets it backward, in fact what happens is you want something to occur first, and then derive pleasure from that thing occuring.
    * *As Butler said, we have desires for things outside us just as things outside us, and we often wouldnâ€™t get the pleasures we do without having those desires.*
* Concept that natural selection would favour those who have INSTINCTUAL desire to promote altrusitic behaviour, and pleasure arrives as a by-product after the act, instead of pleasure being the main arbiter by which we make our decisions.
* Types of pleasure
    1. simple pleasures that are discrete items in your consciousness
    2. simple pleasures that pervade your consciousness like a good mood
    3. complex, pleasures that revolve around a particular object, like a friend's promotion or your favourite team winning
    4. complex, pleasures that revolve around a more extended object, like your whole life

## 2. `The Experience Machine (pg 42-45)` by Robert Noczik

* *What else could matter to us, other than how our lives feel from the inside?*
* *What is most disturbing about them (these machines, experience machine, trasnfromation machine, change machine) is their living of our lives for us.*

## 3. `Higher and Lower Pleasures` by Singer P

* *Utilitarianism:* Pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure as the prevention of pain.
* Concept of enjoying inferior pleasures due to men's proclivity to latch on to the "nearest" pleasure, not necesarily the one that would give them the greatest satisfaction
