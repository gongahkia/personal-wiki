* **Society vs Individual impact** (self-satisficing --> profit satisficing economic level of output for a firm)
* Capitalism promulgates the growth of bullshit jobs

### Homo Economicus Alienation

* Wage worker vs Commissioned worker
* Shift from **artisinal bespoke tailored** production --> System of **mass** production
    * Single worker responsible for the entire product
    * Worker is part of an assembly line (systemisation of the divison of labour)
* Historically..
    * **Apprenticeship** system
* **Homo Economicus**: *economic assumption* that is the corpus of capitalist thought, that each person acts as a rational economic actor, sole purpose is to maximise utility through the consumption of goods and services
* **How can workers influence the existing capitalist system?**
    * **Wage-labour relationship**: labour bears the burden when there is a desired increase in output for the same raw materials
* **Wage-labour relationship** is altered through the introduction of the commissioned worker, there is now as Marx explicates 'species-essence', profit-incentive drives desire for R&D for small businesses.
    * 'species-essence': creativity
* **Compensatory consumption** 
    * Corporations provide multiple tiers for product, allowing for instant gratification at differentiated price points for every income level

## Marx is an alien

Alienation of the masses on all levels.

To understand Marx's ideas of alienation, we first need to comprehend his views on work. Marx believed that work, or labor, is a fundamental part of human existence. It's how we use our physical and mental abilities to create things and meet our basic needs. In a just society, he argued, work should allow people to express themselves, develop their skills, and contribute to the well-being of society as a whole. 
* TLDR: No more species-essence (creativity) for you

1. **Alienation (Estrangement):** Marx argued that under capitalism, many workers feel alienated from their work. This means they experience a sense of disconnection, dissatisfaction, and even dehumanization in their jobs. Marx identified four main types of alienation:
    * **Alienation from the Product:** Workers are extremely disconnected from the final product.
    * **Alienation from the Process:** Division of labour neccesitates the honing on on a certain function
    * **Alienation from Others:** Capitalism's gruelling focus on economic producivity neccesitates pitting workers against each other to drive labour productivity. Increased competition between workers estranges individuals from each other.
    * **Alienation from Human Nature:** Detachment and enforced separation of work from one's species-essence (creativity), diminishing SOL.
