### Under `Tort law`...

#### Eg. `Tort of negligence`
Being less careful than legally required in certain circumstances, violating the *duty of care*.
* Duty of care: A universal duty one has to others to be careful.

> A commits the `tort of negligence` when:
> * A owes a duty of care to B, to take a certain amount of care to avoid harming B.
> * A breaches that duty, by not taking enough care.
> * A thereby causes harm to B.

## Case study: [Donoghue v Stevenson](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/donoghue-v-stevenson.php)

#### Who?

* Who plaintiff? 
    * *Donoghue*
* Who defendant? 
    * *Stevenson --> Manafacturer*
* What courts heard && ruled on the dispute?

#### What?

* Donoghue was gifted the snail beer, therefore not binded by contract.
* Donoghue has to sue Stevenson under the `tort of negligence` for neglecting duty of care.
* Stevenson died.
* Matter handled out of court.

#### Thoughts?

##### Lord Buckmaster
* 'Stevenson is not liable to Donoghue.'
* 'We can't change the law just cuz the plaintiff is sympathetic, must follow OG principles'.

##### Lord Atkin
* Deio-Christian idea of the `neighbour` principle, Stevenson should be held liable by Donoghue.

> Lurking behind many court decisions are the base philosphocal positions and understanding of other implications that each judge takes.
