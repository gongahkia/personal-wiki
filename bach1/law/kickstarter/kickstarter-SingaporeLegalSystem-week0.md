## Very generally...

    * MPs hold Government ACCOUNTABLE by asking questions to Ministers

* `Cabinet`:
    * **Ministers + Prime Minister**
    * Ministers *(who form the cabinet)* are drawn from the parliment
        * President chooses the Prime Minister *(leader of the party with most seats in Parliment)
        * The Prime Minister chooses Ministers from among MPs  

* `Legislature`:
    * **Parliment + President**
    * Have the authority to make PRIMARY legislature

* `Government`:
    * **Executive Government**
    * a set of state institutions, ministries, statutory boards that put laws into action
    * Parliment IS NOT the Government

* `President`:
    * **President**
    * Power to veto certain choices made by the Government
    * Power to veto certain types of legislation
    * Ceromonial roles
    * Symbolic figurehead for national unity

    * Legislative drafter
    * Public Prosecutor *(PP)*

* `Courts and the Judiciary`
    * HEAR and DECIDE legal disputes according to law
    * implicitly DEVELOP the `common law` in the course of deciding legal disputes

## Sources of law

* `Constitution`
    * Lays out various rules on how the state should be constituted.
        * Contains most of the laws about the LEGAL SYSTEM *(courts, parliment, all governing entities)* to begin with.
    * States fundamental rights that other laws cannot violate.
    * It can be amended, but is much harder to amend than other pieces of legislation.

* `Legislation` *(statues)*
    * `Primary legislation`: Acts of Parliment
        * Made by the Legislature *(President + Parliment)*
        * Acts of Parliment can be found at [Singapore Statutes](https://sso.agc.gov.sg)
    * `Secondary`/`Subsidiary`/`Delegated legislation`: Regulations, Rules, Orders
        * Made by persons who have been delegated legislative power *(typically Ministers of Public Servants)*
        * *eg. COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020*, the **primary** legislation, creates *COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020*, the **subsidiary** legislation

* `Case law`
    * `Common law`
    * Implicit understanding of the "law" created by courts in their deciding of legal disputes
    * Latin phrase *stare decisis*, meaning "binding precedent"
        * **Vertical stare decisis**: a judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierachy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case
        * **Horizontal stare decisis**: NOT APPLICABLE in Singapore, each court is not bound to its own previous decisions
        * NOTE THAT even if a case is not binding, it is still persuasive in influencing the judge's reasoning
        * Case law can be found in the [Singapore law report](https://www.sal.org.sg/Resources-Tools/LawNet) and [Supreme Court's website](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments).
        * Legislation may OVERRIDE case law.

## The Courts of Singapore

> Taken from [**Article 94**](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P18-#pr94-)of the *Constitution of the Republic of Singapore*.

### Fundamental statements

The JUDICIAL POWER of the state can be vested only in the `Supreme court` and `Subordinate courts`.

#### But why? 

* Courts have certain features that make them appropriate for exercising judicial power.
* Courts authoratively state what the facts are, and apply the law to the facts.
    1. REALITY and APPEARANCE of **decisional independence** and **impartiality**
    2. application of PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS
    3. adherence *(as a general rule)* to the OPEN COURT PRINCIPLE
        * Singapore Law Report
        * Members of the public are *(generallY)* open to the public
    4. provision of reasons for the court's decisions

### Looking at the terms...

* `Supreme court`
    * Greatest amount of jurisdiction and authority over a given matter.
    * Comprises...
        1. `HIGH COURT`
            * `General Division` *(unlimited jurisdiction to hear and rule on ANY dispute)*
                * `Family Division`
                * `Singapore International Commercial Court`
            * `Appellate Division` *(hears certain appeals from the General Division)*
        2. `COURT OF APPEAL`
            * Deals with the more complex questions regarding the law

* `Subordinate court`
    * Limited jurisidiction and authority over certain matters.
    * Comprises...
        1. `STATE COURTS`
            * `District courts`
            * `Magistrates' courts`
            * `Coroners' courts`
            * `Small Claims Tribunals`
            * `Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals`
            * `Employment Claims Tribunals`
        2. `FAMILY JUSTICE COURTS`
            * `Family courts`
            * `Youth courts`
        3. `SYARIAH COURT`
        4. `OTHER COURTS`
            * Subordinate Military courts
            * Military court of appeal

#### Why so many types of courts?

* Judges have ***greater specialisation*** regarding hearing and deciding cases.
* `System of appeals`: Many issues of Subordinate courts can be brought to higher courts for appeal *(especially the more complex ones)*.
* `System of BINDING PRECEDENT`: higher courts bind lower courts decision-wise.
