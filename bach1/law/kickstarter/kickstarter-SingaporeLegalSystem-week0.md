## Sources of law

* `Constitution`
    * Lays out various rules on how the state should be constituted.
        * Contains most of the laws about the LEGAL SYSTEM *(courts, parliment, all governing entities)* to begin with.
    * States fundamental rights that other laws cannot violate.
    * It can be amended, but is much harder to amend than other pieces of legislation.

* `Legislation` *(statues)*
    * `Primary legislation`: Acts of Parliment
        * Made by the Legislature *(President + Parliment)*
        * Acts of Parliment can be found at [Singapore Statutes](https://sso.agc.gov.sg)
    * `Secondary`/`Subsidiary`/`Delegated legislation`: Regulations, Rules, Orders
        * Made by persons who have been delegated legislative power *(typically Ministers of Public Servants)*
        * *eg. COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020*, the **primary** legislation, creates *COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020*, the **subsidiary** legislation

* `Case law`
    * `Common law`
    * Implicit understanding of the "law" created by courts in their deciding of legal disputes
    * Latin phrase *stare decisis*, meaning "binding precedent"
        * **Vertical stare decisis**: a judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierachy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case
        * **Horizontal stare decisis**: NOT APPLICABLE in Singapore, each court is not bound to its own previous decisions
        * NOTE THAT even if a case is not binding, it is still persuasive in influencing the judge's reasoning
        * Case law can be found in the [Singapore law report](https://www.sal.org.sg/Resources-Tools/LawNet) and [Supreme Court's website](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments).
        * Legislation may OVERRIDE case law.
