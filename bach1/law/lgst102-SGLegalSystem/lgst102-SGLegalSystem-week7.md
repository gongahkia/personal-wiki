## Learn some shit

### Ian Chai says...

* "Don't rush ahead to your conclusion. Be procedural when parsing through the facts to logic to the conlusion."

## `actus reas`, `mens reas`

When looking at criminal cases:

* *actus reus*: physical element 
* *mens rea*: mental aspect

In a Criminal trial, prosecution must prove the existence of both aspects to establish the commission of the crime.

### Rashness v Negligence

* Rashness means doing an act with the **consciousness of a risk that evil consequences will follow** but with the **hope that it will not**. 
* Negligence means **breach of duty** imposed by law

## Mock IP

### Case summary

#### Context

* Note this case is often brought up in Food Safety courses 1 with regard to storing of raw foods with pre-prepared foods together.

#### Material facts (facts of the case)

* Accused is Mr S Shankar, 44 year old Indian Male 
* Accused ran a rojak stall in factory canteen in Jurong
* 20 Aug 2019, 45 workers ate rojak from accused's stall, 44 fell sick and recovered, *1 passed away* from food poisoning
	1. Dead worker's autopsy showed bacteria found in raw meat caused death by food poisoning *(Vibrio parahaemolyticus)*
	2. HSA expert opined bacteria usually found in food stored with raw seafood
		* Accused's statement admitted to storing rojak sauce together with raw seafood in the fridge.
* Police called down to scene NEXT DAY only, unable secure samples of Rojak

#### Recommended charges (offences)

1. Determine the *actus reas* and *mens reas* of the charge

2. Distinguish *rashness* and *negligence* for this case since they bring about different tiers of punishment
    * Negligence (the legal term), refers to explicit breach of duty laid out in contract
    * Rashness means doing an act with the **consciousness of a risk that evil consequences will follow** but with the **hope that it will not**. 

* IO recommends charge of 1 count of s304A of penal code *(causing death by rash or negligent act)* 
>  **304A**: Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any ***rash or negligent act*** not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished by...
>       (a) in the case of a rash act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with both; or	
>       (b) in the case of a NEGLIGENT act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.
>  **Sale of Food Act 1973** S5, S19
* AGC previously affirmed conditional warning for 44 other cases

#### Relevant evidence

##### Accused's statement

* Incriminating facts
	* *"I always prepare my rojak fresh in the morning from 6 am onwards. But my sauce I make in big batches once every few days then keep in the fridge. This is a normal practice among hawkers."*
	* *"I only have one fridge. I keep all my ingredients in there, including raw seafood. I do not remember if I had any raw seafood in the fridge on 19 August 2019. I do not remember if I kept my sauce in the fridge on 19 August 2019, but I usually do."*

##### HSA statement

* Regarding autopsy and bacteria
	* *"I have been asked by the Police to furnish this report on the characteristics of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacterium. This bacterium is commonly found in raw seafood."*
	* *"The presence of the bacterium on cooked food is likely the result of cooked food being stored together with raw seafood for extended periods of time. This usually occurs, for example, when cooked food is placed in refrigerator together with uncooked seafood. It is never advisable to store cooked and uncooked food together, as this could easily lead to contamination and harmful effects to whomever subsequently consumes the cooked food – up to and including death."*

##### Mr Roger Lim's statement

* Point 3 regarding preparation of rojak ending with Accused drizzling rojak sauce from fridge before serving

### Weaknesses in your case

Criminal law needs us to argue that there is both an actus reus and a mens reus.

1. Cannot prove ACTUS REUS: *No rojak samples secured* --> Merely an inference
2. MENS REUS: Infer to MENS REUS
    * Shankar cleared out fridge after being informed by mangager, he appreciated the risk
    * Shankar would have had to take the 

### Inferences drawn

* Accused likely stored raw meat above the rojak sauce, and left the rojak sauce uncovered below, causing the presence of the *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* bacteria in the rojak, which was drizzled on the rojak (according to account of Mr Roger Lim point 3)

### My recommendation

* I would agree with the IO's recommendation for charge of 1 count of s304A of penal code *(causing death by NEGLIGENT act)*, amounting to 5 year imprisonment and or fine
    * evident Mr Shankar (accused) had no idea of what he did wrong, but being a hawker should have been expected to know basic food safety hygiene 
        * `Objective test`: Even without his position as a hawker, any reasonable person SHOULD know storing raw food with cooked food carries the risk of transmission, constitutes RASHNESS.
* I would propose the additional charge of 44 counts of s336b of penal code *(punishment for act which endangers life or the personal safety of others)*, amounting to 3 month imprisonment and or fine of $1,500

#### Cursory considerations

* Hawker Stall owners are required to complete the NEA Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC), which covers the below points.
	* According to [NEA's handbook](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/resource/guidelines-on-proper-storage-of-food-in-refrigerators.pdf) available to the public on "guidelines on proper storage of food in refrigerators and maintenance of refrigerators", which was *last updated 31 Dec 2016*, **clause 2b and 2c** clearly outline guidelines with regard to storing food in refrigerators.
* Resulting rationale
	* As such, Accused is unable to feign ignorance with regard to the proper guidelines for food storage.
	* Accused should be penalised accordingly for the food poisonings of the 44 other workers, to highlight severity of not adhering to food safety guidelines and to deter future acts of negligence by those preparing food.

## Readings

1. *"Legal Systems in a Digital Age: Pursuing the Next Frontier"* by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon

    1. **Transformation of Legal Systems:** Technology, especially generative AI (aid research, though accuracy limited), is changing legal work, roles, remuneration models, and generating new legal issues (Crypto, NFTs). These changes are expected to accelerate further.

    2. **Urgent Reforms Needed:** Legal systems must adapt to technological advances to meet public expectations, harness opportunities, and address risks. This includes rethinking the organization, remuneration, and regulation of legal service providers.

    3. **Revamping Legal Education:** Legal education for lawyers needs to be reimagined, covering both basic and continuous learning. Additionally, programs should be developed to train allied legal professionals.

    4. **Using Technology in Courts:** Courts should adopt digital tools to enhance access to justice. This involves using technology to assist court users and considering its use in supporting adjudicative work in certain cases.

    5. **Organization of Legal Service Providers**: Traditional law firm structures, characterized by a pyramid model with many associates and paralegals, will change due to the integration of technology. There is a pertinent need to hire "legal technologists" with expertise in technology and allied legal professionals (ALPs) with skills in data analysis and design thinking. This could lead to a shift from a pyramid to a more streamlined "rocket" structure.

    > In other words, job creation for CnL students :)

    6. **Remuneration**: The changing landscape of legal work due to technology means we need to explore alternative pricing structures, such as fixed fees and "freemium" models. These emphasize the importance of compensating lawyers with specialized skills appropriately.

    7. **Regulation of Legal Service Providers**: There is a need to regulate legal service providers, especially in cases involving AI and technology, which raise questions about the scope of services AI providers can offer and the liability for incorrect advice. 

2. *"The Elements of Style"* by William Strunk Jr and EB White

    1. **Concise and Clear Language**: Be clear and concise language in writing. Avoid unnecessary words. Express ideas directly and succinctly. Be **clear**, **convincing**, **compelling** (3 Cs).

    2. **Active Voice**: Active voice should be used over the passive voice. The active voice generally makes sentences more engaging and direct.

    3. **Avoiding Wordiness**: Brevity above all else, avoid wordy expressions and over-technical jargon. Be **clear** and **precise** in your writing and argumentation. 

    4. **Grammar and Usage**: Ensure grammer and punctuation are correctly used.

    5. **Elementary Principles of Composition**: Principles of composition, which include organizing ideas logically, using transitions effectively, and maintaining consistency in style and tone.
