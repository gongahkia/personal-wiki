### Case summary
#### Context
* Note this case is often brought up in Food Safety courses 1 with regard to storing of raw foods with pre-prepared foods together.
#### Material facts (facts of the case)
* Accused is Mr S Shankar, 44 year old Indian Male 
* Accused ran a rojak stall in factory canteen in Jurong
* 20 Aug 2019, 45 workers ate rojak from accused's stall, 44 fell sick and recovered, *1 passed away* from food poisoning
	1. Dead worker's autopsy showed bacteria found in raw meat caused death by food poisoning *(Vibrio parahaemolyticus)*
	2. HSA expert opined ==bacteria usually found in food stored with raw seafood==
		* Accused's statement admitted to storing rojak sauce together with raw seafood in the fridge.
* Police called down to scene NEXT DAY only, unable secure samples of Rojak
#### Recommended charges (offences)
* IO recommends charge of ==1 count of s304A of penal code== *(causing death by rash or negligent act)*
>  **304A**: Whoever causes the ==death of any person== by doing any ***rash or negligent act*** not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished by...
		(a) in the case of a ==rash act==, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with both; or	
		(b) in the case of a ==negligent act==, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.
* AGC previously affirmed ==conditional warning for 44 other cases==
#### Relevant evidence
##### Accused's statement
* Incriminating facts
	* *"I always prepare my rojak fresh in the morning from 6 am onwards. But my sauce I make in big batches once every few days then keep in the fridge. This is a normal practice among hawkers."*
	* *"I only have one fridge. I keep all my ingredients in there, including raw seafood. I do not remember if I had any raw seafood in the fridge on 19 August 2019. I do not remember if I kept my sauce in the fridge on 19 August 2019, but I usually do."*
##### HSA statement
* Regarding autopsy and bacteria
	* *"I have been asked by the Police to furnish this report on the characteristics of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacterium. This bacterium is commonly found in raw seafood."*
	* *"The presence of the bacterium on cooked food is likely the result of cooked food being stored together with raw seafood for extended periods of time. This usually occurs, for example, when cooked food is placed in refrigerator together with uncooked seafood. It is never advisable to store cooked and uncooked food together, as this could easily lead to contamination and harmful effects to whomever subsequently consumes the cooked food – up to and including death."*
##### Mr Roger Lim's statement
* Point 3 regarding preparation of rojak ending with Accused drizzling rojak sauce from fridge before serving
---
### Weaknesses in your case
* I can't find any oops `>_<`
### Inferences drawn
* Accused likely ==stored raw meat above the rojak sauce, and left the rojak sauce uncovered below==, causing the presence of the *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* bacteria in the rojak, which was drizzled on the rojak (according to account of Mr Roger Lim point 3)
### My recommendation
* I would agree with the IO's recommendation for charge of ==1 count of s304A of penal code== *(causing death by rash or negligent act)*, amounting to 5 year imprisonment and or fine
* I would propose the additional charge of 44 counts of s336b of penal code *(punishment for act which endangers life or the personal safety of others)*, amounting to 3 month imprisonment and or fine of $1,500
#### Cursory considerations
* Hawker Stall owners are required to complete the NEA Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC), which covers the below points.
	* According to [NEA's handbook](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/resource/guidelines-on-proper-storage-of-food-in-refrigerators.pdf) available to the public on "guidelines on proper storage of food in refrigerators and maintenance of refrigerators", which was *last updated 31 Dec 2016*, ==**clause 2b and 2c** clearly outline guidelines== with regard to storing food in refrigerators.
* ==Resulting rationale==
	* As such, Accused is unable to feign ignorance with regard to the proper guidelines for food storage.
	* Accused should be penalised accordingly for the food poisonings of the 44 other workers, to highlight severity of not adhering to food safety guidelines and to deter future acts of negligence by those preparing food.
