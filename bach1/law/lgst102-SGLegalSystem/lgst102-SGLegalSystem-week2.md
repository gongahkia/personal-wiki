## Difference between Rules and Principles

### [Legal Profession Rules 2015 9(1)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/LPA1966-S706-2015?ProvIds=P13-P21-#pr9-)

> **Principles**
> 
> 1. A legal practitioner has a duty to assist in the administration of justice, and must act honourably in the interests of the administration of justice.  
> 2. A legal practitioner has an obligation to ensure that any work done by the legal practitioner, whether preparatory or otherwise, relating to proceedings before any court or tribunal, will uphold the integrity of the court or tribunal and will contribute to the attainment of justice.  
> 3. A legal practitioner must always be truthful and accurate in the legal practitioner’s communications with any person involved in or associated with any proceedings before a court or tribunal.  
> 4. A legal practitioner must not present, or permit to be presented, any evidence or information which the legal practitioner knows to be false.  
> 5. A legal practitioner must, in any proceedings before a court or tribunal, conduct the legal practitioner’s case in a manner which maintains the fairness, integrity and efficiency of those proceedings and which is consistent with due process.  
> 6. A legal practitioner must comply with all applicable laws and practice directions in the conduct of the legal practitioner’s case.  

### Primary and Secondary legislature, Creatures of Statute

1. Primary Legislature *(Acts of parliment)*
2. Secondary Legislature *(Rules, Regulations, Subsidiary legislature)*
3. Legislation && Statute are *interchangable terms*.

* *eg.* MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) has its powers *bestowed on it* by the `MAS Act`.
    * MAS is also termed a *creature of statute*.
* This allows MAS to create **Secondary Legislation** within the confines of the power bestowed to it by the Primary Legislation (Acts of Parliment, `MAS Act`).
    * *eg.* [MAS imposes additional capital requirement on DBS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-imposes-further-additional-capital-requirement-on-dbs-bank-for-disruption-of-banking-services)
