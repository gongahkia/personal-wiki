### Definitions 

**Law**: a *system of rules* governing society

## Sources of law

### 1. Constitution
* **Lays out various rules** on how a state should be CONSTRUCTED *(constituted)*
    * Contains most of the laws about the LEGAL SYSTEM *(courts, parliment, all governing entities)* to begin with
    * Lays out who can be a minister, who can be a president, and their roles and responsiblities
* States fundamental rights that other laws cannot violate
* CAN BE AMENDED, but is **much harder to amend** than other pieces of legislation
    * Most of Constitution's articles can be amended with a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BILL that has **support of MORE THAN 2/3 of Members of Parliment**

### 2. Legislation *(STATUTES)*

1. **Primary Legislature** *(Acts of parliment)*
2. **Secondary Legislature** *(Rules, Regulations, Subsidiary legislature)*

> Legislation && Statute are *interchangable terms*.

#### PRIMARY legislation
* Acts of Parliment
* Made by the Legislature *(President + Parliment)*
* Acts of Parliment can be found at [Singapore Statutes](https://sso.agc.gov.sg), include the word ACT at the back 
    * *eg.* Housing and Development ACT

#### SECONDARY legislation
* *A.K.A* Subsidiary legislation / Delegated legislation
* Regulations, Rules, Orders
* Legislation made by persons who have been delegated legislative power *(typically Ministers of Public Servants)*
* Those persons can create regulatory law WITHOUT having to have a bill passed in Parliment for agreement and then to Presidential council for minority right and then President for assent.
    1. *eg. COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020*, the **PRIMARY** legislation which enabled the COVID Committee to create **SECONDARY** legislation, *COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020*
    2. *eg.* MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) has its powers *bestowed to it* by the `MAS Act`.
        * `MAS` is a **creature of statute**.
        * `MAS Act` is a piece of **Primary Legislation** (ACT OF PARLIMENT) that allows the `MAS` to create **Secondary Legislation** (REGULATION, RULES, SUBSIDIARY LEGISLATURE) within the confines of the power bestowed to it.
            * *eg.* [MAS imposes additional capital requirement on DBS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-imposes-further-additional-capital-requirement-on-dbs-bank-for-disruption-of-banking-services)


### 3. Case law

* Synonymous with `Common law`
    * The implicit understanding of the "law" created by courts in their deciding of legal disputes  
    * Acts as a system to *guard against EDGE CASES* that Civil Law does not account for, where the underlying foundational principles guide rule-making and decision-making in law
* Latin phrase *stare decisis*, meaning "binding precedent"  
    * **Vertical stare decisis**: a judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierachy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case  
    * **Horizontal stare decisis**: NOT APPLICABLE in Singapore, each court is not bound to its own previous decisions  
    * Case law can be found in the [Singapore law report](https://www.sal.org.sg/Resources-Tools/LawNet) and [Supreme Court's website](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments).  
    * Primary and Secondary legislation (passed by the Legislature) will often OVERRIDE case law
> NOTE THAT even if a case is not binding, it is still persuasive in influencing the judge's reasoning.

## Separation of powers  

* State needs LAWS to function.
* **Three-branch structure** of...
    1. **Judiciary**: Power to ENSURE LAWS ARE FOLLOWED
    2. **Executive**: Power to EXECUTE LAWS
    3. **Legislature**: Power to CREATE LAWS
* Ensures CHECKS AND BALANCES to prevent abuse of power by any one of the judicial entities
* Seperation of powers enshrined in the Constitution, which holds guidelines on how entities of the State should be constituted

## The Courts of Singapore

> Taken from [**Article 94**](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P18-#pr94-) of the *Constitution of the Republic of Singapore*.

### Fundamental statements

The JUDICIAL POWER of the state can be vested only in the `Supreme court` and `Subordinate courts`.

#### But why? 

* Courts have certain features that make them appropriate for exercising judicial power.
* Courts authoratively state what the facts are, and apply the law to the facts.
    1. REALITY and APPEARANCE of **decisional independence** and **impartiality**
    2. application of PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS
    3. adherence *(as a general rule)* to the OPEN COURT PRINCIPLE
        * Singapore Law Report
        * Members of the public are *(generallY)* open to the public
    4. provision of reasons for the court's decisions

### Looking at the terms...

1. `Supreme court`
    * Greatest amount of jurisdiction and authority over a given matter.
    * Comprises...
        1. `HIGH COURT`
            * `General Division` *(unlimited jurisdiction to hear and rule on ANY dispute)*
                * `Family Division`
                * `Singapore International Commercial Court`
            * `Appellate Division` *(hears certain appeals from the General Division)*
        2. `COURT OF APPEAL`
            * Deals with the more complex questions regarding the law

2. `Subordinate court`
    * Limited jurisidiction and authority over certain matters.
    * Comprises...
        1. `STATE COURTS`
            * `District courts`
            * `Magistrates' courts`
            * `Coroners' courts`

            * `Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals`
            * `Employment Claims Tribunals`
        2. `FAMILY JUSTICE COURTS`
            * `Family courts`
            * `Youth courts`

        4. `OTHER COURTS`
            * Subordinate Military courts
            * Military court of appeal

#### Why so many types of courts?

* Judges have ***greater specialisation*** regarding hearing and deciding cases.
* `System of appeals`: Many issues of Subordinate courts can be brought to higher courts for appeal *(especially the more complex ones)*.
* `System of BINDING PRECEDENT`: higher courts bind lower courts decision-wise.
