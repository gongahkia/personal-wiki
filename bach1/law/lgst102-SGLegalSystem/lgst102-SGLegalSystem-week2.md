### Primary and Secondary legislature, Creatures of Statute

1. Primary Legislature *(Acts of parliment)*
2. Secondary Legislature *(Rules, Regulations, Subsidiary legislature)*
3. Legislation && Statute are *interchangable terms*.

* *eg.* MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) has its powers *bestowed to it* by the `MAS Act`.
    * MAS is also termed a *creature of statute*.
* This allows MAS to create **Secondary Legislation** within the confines of the power bestowed to it by the Primary Legislation (Acts of Parliment, `MAS Act`).
    * *eg.* [MAS imposes additional capital requirement on DBS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-imposes-further-additional-capital-requirement-on-dbs-bank-for-disruption-of-banking-services)

### `Case law`  

* Synonymous with `Common law`
    * The implicit understanding of the "law" created by courts in their deciding of legal disputes  
* Latin phrase *stare decisis*, meaning "binding precedent"  
    * **Vertical stare decisis**: a judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierachy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case  
    * **Horizontal stare decisis**: NOT APPLICABLE in Singapore, each court is not bound to its own previous decisions  
    * NOTE THAT even if a case is not binding, it is still persuasive in influencing the judge's reasoning  
    * Case law can be found in the [Singapore law report](https://www.sal.org.sg/Resources-Tools/LawNet) and [Supreme Court's website](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments).  
    * Primary and Secondary legislation will often OVERRIDE case law

### Separation of powers  

* State needs laws to function
* **Three-branch structure** of...
    1. Judiciary: Power to ENSURE LAWS ARE FOLLOWED
    2. Executive: Power to EXECUTE LAWS
    3. Legislature: Power to CREATE LAWS
* Ensures CHECKS AND BALANCES to prevent abuse of power by any one of the judicial entities
* Seperation of powers enshrined in the Constitution, which holds guidelines on how entities of the State should be constituted

### State entities
