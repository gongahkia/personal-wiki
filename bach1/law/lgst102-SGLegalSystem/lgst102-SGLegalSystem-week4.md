## Learning Objective and Questions
**Objective**: To be able to understand cases, analyse and apply them. To understand how the common law system works.  
**Questions**:
1. What is _Stare Decisis_?
	* *"Stare Decisis"* refers to the law of ==binding precedent==, literally translating to =='to stand by things decided'==. It is normally referenced within the context of Common Law, wherein lower courts follow the past rulings of higher courts, and courts tend to honour past judgements made within the same court when ruling on current cases.
2. What is a _ratio decidendi_ and _obiter dicta_?
	* *"Ratio decideni"* literally translates to =='rationale for the decision'==, referring to the fact that Judges need to provide a sufficient rationale (chain of reasoning) for their rulings in Court.
	* *"Obiter dicta"* literally translates to =='that which is said in passing'==, referring to an ==incidental statement== made by the judge which is **not necessary** for the final decision and ruling of a case.
