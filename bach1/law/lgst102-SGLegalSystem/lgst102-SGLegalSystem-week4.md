## Ian Chai says:
* ==Never delegate your critical judgement to someone else.== Just because SG has a Common Law system does not mean that we blindly follow the past judgement of higher courts.
## Learning Objective and Questions
**Objective**: To be able to understand cases, analyse and apply them. To understand how the common law system works.  
**Questions**:
1. What is _Stare Decisis_?
	* *"Stare Decisis"* refers to the law of ==binding precedent==, literally translating to =='to stand by things decided'==. It is normally referenced within the context of Common Law, wherein lower courts follow the past rulings of higher courts, and courts tend to honour past judgements made within the same court when ruling on current cases.
2. What is a _ratio decidendi_ and _obiter dicta_?
	* *"Ratio decideni"* literally translates to =='rationale for the decision'==, referring to the fact that Judges need to provide a sufficient rationale (chain of reasoning) for their rulings in Court.
	* *"Obiter dicta"* literally translates to =='that which is said in passing'==, referring to an ==incidental statement== made by the judge which is **not necessary** for the final decision and ruling of a case.
**Readings**:
1. [The law of negligence](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/About-Singapore-Law/Commercial-Law/ch-20-the-law-of-negligence)
	* *Tort of Negligence*: 
		* Defendant owes Plaintiff a legal duty to take care
		* Breach of legal duty by the Defendant
		* Breach caused the Plaintiff recoverable damage
	* Duty of care fleshed out in *The Neighbour Principle* in `Donoghue v Stevenson` by Lord Atkin
		* Defendant must avoid acts or omissions which will foreseeably harm persons who are *so closely and directly affected by his acts or omissions* that he **ought to have** them in mind as being so affected.  
		* Tests for the Neighbour Principle are built around the concept of foreseeability. 
		* More factors inherent to establishing duty continue be taken into account in current and future readings revolving around *The Neighbour Principle.*
			* `Anns Two-Stage Test`
			* `Caparo Three-part Test`
			* Singapore's approach, the `Spandeck Test`
		* Special situations with regard to the duty of care
		* Despite **physical damage** being a hallmark of a violation of `duty of care`, courts might hold that there was no duty in certain exceptions.
			* `Marc Rich & Co v Bishop Rock Marine Co Ltd [1996]`
		* Courts will not recognise duty when there are public policy reasons to avoid doing so
			* `McFarlane v Tayside Health Board [2000]`
		* Causation of Psychiatric harm
  
## Reflections from last week's discussion
* ==Be *clear*, *concise* and *convincing*.==
* Don't speculate about the facts that could have happened. Just state the charge you think is relevant accordingly.
* Just state the charge, and the Statute or Rule from the given source accordingly
* If unsure of the facts, just say *"There is insufficient evidence or insufficient proof to draw a conclusion."*
* Many of the items on the penal code will be evaluated based on multiple `if else` conditions presented, and we must ensure that all limbs are fulfilled.
## Types of legal systems
1. ==Common Law systems== 
	* Retain the *Statute of Westminster*
	* Practice the concept of *stare decisis* (order of binding precedence) in their courts
	* Countries that practice this:
		* Singapore
		* UK
		* Malaysia
		* India
2. ==Civil Law systems==
	* Follow the statute to the word, there is **NO concept** of binding precedence to higher courts
	* Countries that practice this:
		* China
		* North Korea
		* Vietnam
		* France
		* Germany
		* Greece
		* Italy
		* Japan
		* Chile
		* Mexico
		* Russia
		* Spain
3. ==Equity Law systems==
## Case Citations
### Neutral and Reported Case Citations
Generally speaking, reported case citations are favoured over neutral ones.
### Criminal Cases
* `SLR`: citing the Singapore Law Reports are preferred as the official publication, rulings normally transcribed by law students, **reported case citation**
* `SGDC`: Singapore District Court, **neutral case citation**
### Civil Cases
* `SGCA`: Singapore Court of Appeal, **neutral case citation**
* `SGHC`: Singapore High Court, **neutral case citation**
## Introduction to Common Law  
### Foreign cases
* Foreign cases are not binding on Singapore's cases since we are a separate *legal system*, they do hold a certain level of **persuasion** in Judge's ruling.
### Advantages of Common Law
* Flexibility and adaptability, incremental development of the law
* Filling in "gaps" in the justice system
* Development of the law of tort
	* `Donoghue v Stevenson [1932]`
	* `Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978]`
	* `Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defense Science & Technology Agency [2007]`
### Disadvantages of Common Law
* Slow, requires time for case law to accrete and settle
* Disorganised, generally points of law aren't clarified unless a certain case arises
* Contradictory, judges of the same level can have differing views
	* `Singapore Democractic Party v Attorney-General [2020] SGHC 25`
	* `The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorny-General [2020] SGHC 36`
### Applying common law
Generally, Courts employ a mix of common law and statutes when making their judgements. In other words, common law supplements statutes.
* Steps to follow:
	1. Is the case *relevant* to the current problem or can it be *distinguished*?
	2. Is the case *binding* on the current judge or *merely persuasive*?
	3. Is the case still *up to date*, or has it been superseded or overturned?
	4. Has the law *changed* since the case the case was decided (eg. statutory reform)?
	5. Have *external circumstances* changed since the case was decided?
	6. Does the *reasoning* in the case make sense?

### Self Practice Exercise
`Wong Leng Si Rachel v Wu Su Han Olivia [2022] SGHC 511`
* Identify the *ratio* of this case and any *orbiter* comments. Determine which courts this case is binding on.
* Definition
	* *Ratio*: rationale for the judgement
	* *Orbiter*: that which is said in passing
#### Response
##### Ratio
* In many discovering applications, party resisting will claim the applicant is "only fishing".
* However, the principle against such applications is that a good reason is required for a party to request discovery of such documents. If the documents are expected by one party to be produced by the other, and they are relevant to the trial, they must be produced.
	* *"It is not a mere fishing expedition if fish has in fact been spotted."
##### Orbiter
* *"Mr Lun also argued that the application by the defendant was scandalous and vexatious. The evidence sought may prove to be scandalous â€” if true, obviously, but it is scandalous only because of the nature of the subject matter of the defamation. The plaintiff had chosen to sue and the defendant seeks to justify her statements. The scandal will fall heavily on the plaintiff or the defendant, depending on who succeeds in this action, but this application in itself is neither scandalous nor vexatious."*
##### Courts this case is binding on
* Case ruled in High Court of Singapore
* Case is binding on all subordinate courts, namely state courts and family courts
