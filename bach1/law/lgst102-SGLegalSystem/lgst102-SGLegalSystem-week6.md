### Persuasive reasoning
* Assertion vs Argument *beyond a reasonable doubt*
	* Clear, Convincing, Compelling
* Induction entails falsifiability of the premise as a concept

### Rhetoric
1. Pathos: Appealing to emotion
2. Logos: Appealing to logic
3. Ethos: Appealing to established authority of orator

#### Uhhh shit
* Red Herring: not direct answer to the question
* Dead horse: overdone topic
* BOP (Burden of Proof)

### Developing Case Theory
1. Identify legal issues 
	* ***Statutes***, ***Case law*** to solidify watery definitions of legal issues
2. Words
	* *Actus Reus*: question of fact proved by evidence
	* *Mens Rea*: involves issue of law
3. Facts, Inferences, Context and Importance of Evidence, Types of Evidence
4. Confront weak points of argument
5. What's the endgame of the argument?
