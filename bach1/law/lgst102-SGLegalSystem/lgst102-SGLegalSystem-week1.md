## Pre-readings summary

### 1. `Historian as Judge`
* Common law is based on judicial decisions about the legal implications of a lot of human stories, incredibly historical process.
    * Private interest undoubtably affects the development of common law.
* French civil code achieves near complete level of intellectual abstraction.
* English law intensely human.

1. Understanding the rationale of a rule of law requires HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
    * Contrast between Historians, who question the authority of sources and work from first principles, and Lawyers, who were too respectful of authority *(esp Common law)* and thus bound by their books and history.

### 2. `Virtual hearings without tears`

* Dress properly, have basic Zoom etiquette. Lol.

### 3. `Sexual misconduct in Universities`

* Imposition of sanctions must be based on principles, not just guidelines.
    * Guidelines: Road signs and Road markings
    * Principles: We want people to stay safe
* Principles
    1. Denunciation is the signalling effect of the sanction.
        * A light sentence for a crime signals that the crime is effectively 'no big deal'.
    2. Retribution
        * Punishment for antisocial acts
        * Making the retribution fit the crime
    3. Deterrence, specific and general
    4. Protection of the public
        * Barring flashers from re-entering campus

### 4. `AI, work and 'outcome-thinking'`

* Outcome-thinking
    * Consider the outcome of each profession to determine the future of the profession
        * 'Citizens don't want soldiers, they want security'
        * 'Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer'
    * The systems that'll replace us are unlikely to work like us.
        * The law needs to ensure that people's rights and obligations to procuring a good will shouldn't hinge on getting a better lawyer

## What is the law?

1. Law sets boundaries.
    * Formalises a set of offences you cannot commit --> Creates a set of acceptable actions you can follow
* `Rousseau`: [Law is a social contract between the individual and the state](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-social-contract-by-jean-jacques-rousseau0)
* Law is a means by which to assign blame and allocate consequence
* Common law || Case law often sees Courts 'discovering' innate laws in hindsight, pointing to shared universal morality.
