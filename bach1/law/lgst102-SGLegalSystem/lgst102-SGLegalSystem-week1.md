# Pre-readings summary

`Historian as Judge`
* Common law is based on judicial decisions about the legal implications of a lot of human stories, incredibly historical process.
    * Private interest undoubtably affects the development of common law.
* French civil code achieves near complete level of intellectual abstraction.
* English law intensely human.

1. Understanding the rationale of a rule of law requires HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
    * Contrast between Historians, who question the authority of sources and work from first principles, and Lawyers, who were too respectful of authority *(esp Common law)* and thus bound by their books and history.

`Virtual hearings without tears`

* Dress properly, have basic Zoom etiquette. Lol.

`Sexual misconduct in Universities`

* Imposition of sanctions must be based on principles, not ust guidelines.
* Principles
    1. Denunciation is the signalling effect of the sanction.

        * Making the retribution fit the crime

`AI, work and 'outcome-thinking'`

* Outcome-thinking
    * Consider the outcome of each profession to determine the future of the profession
        * 'Citizens don't want soldiers, they want security'
        * 'consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer'
    * The systems that'll replace us are unlikely to work like us.
