## Very generally...

**Law**: a *system of rules* governing society

## Legal institutions in Singapore

1. `Parliment`
    * **Members of Parliment** (MPs) 
    * *democratically representative body* that debate matters of **national significance**
        * meet-the-people sessions to find out the public's needs and desires
    * MPs **hold Government ACCOUNTABLE** by asking questions to Ministers

2. `Legislature`
    * **Parliment + President**
    * Have the authority to make PRIMARY legislature

3. `Cabinet`
    * **Ministers + Prime Minister**
    * Ministers *(who form the cabinet)* are drawn from the **parliment**
        * President chooses the Prime Minister *(leader of the party with most seats in Parliment)*
        * The Prime Minister chooses Ministers from **among MPs**  

4. `Government`
    * **Executive Government**
    * a set of state institutions, ministries, statutory boards that put laws into action
    * Parliment **IS NOT the Government**

5. `President`
    * **President**
    * Power to veto certain choices made by the Government
    * Power to veto certain types of legislation
    * Fulfills ceromonial roles
    * Symbolic figurehead for national unity

6. `Presidential Councils`
    * **Council of Presidential Advisers**
    * **Presidential Council for Minority Rights**
    * **Presidential Council for Religious Harmony**

7. `Attorney General`
    * **Attorney General's Chambers**
    * LEGAL ADVISER to the Government
    * REPRESENTATIVE of the Government && Singapore in relations with other parties or States
    * Legislative drafter
    * Public Prosecutor *(PP)*

8. `Courts and the Judiciary`
    * HEAR and DECIDE legal disputes according to law
    * implicitly DEVELOP the `common law` in the course of deciding legal disputes

## Sources of law

1. `Constitution`
    * **Lays out various rules** on how a state should be CONSTRUCTED *(constituted)*
        * Contains most of the laws about the LEGAL SYSTEM *(courts, parliment, all governing entities)* to begin with
        * Lays out who can be a minister, who can be a president, and their roles and responsiblities
    * States fundamental rights that other laws cannot violate
    * CAN BE AMENDED, but is **much harder to amend** than other pieces of legislation
        * Most of Constitution's articles can be amended with a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BILL that has **support of MORE THAN 2/3 of Members of Parliment**

2. `Legislation` *(STATUTES)*
    1. `PRIMARY legislation`
        * Acts of Parliment
        * Made by the Legislature *(President + Parliment)*
        * Acts of Parliment can be found at [Singapore Statutes](https://sso.agc.gov.sg), have the word ACT at the back 
            * *eg.* Housing and Development Act
    2. `SECONDARY legislation`/`Subsidiary`/`Delegated legislation`
        * Regulations, Rules, Orders
        * Legislation made by persons who have been delegated legislative power *(typically Ministers of Public Servants)*
        * Those persons can create regulatory law WITHOUT having to have a bill passed in Parliment for agreement and then to Presidential council for minority right and then President for assent.
            * *eg. COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020*, the **PRIMARY** legislation, creates *COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020*, the **SECONDARY** legislation

3. `Case law`
    * `Common law`
    * Implicit understanding of the "law" created by courts in their deciding of legal disputes
    * Latin phrase *stare decisis*, meaning "binding precedent"
        * **Vertical stare decisis**: a judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierachy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case
        * **Horizontal stare decisis**: NOT APPLICABLE in Singapore, each court is not bound to its own previous decisions
        * NOTE THAT even if a case is not binding, it is still persuasive in influencing the judge's reasoning
        * Case law can be found in the [Singapore law report](https://www.sal.org.sg/Resources-Tools/LawNet) and [Supreme Court's website](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments).
        * Legislation may OVERRIDE case law.

## The Courts of Singapore

> Taken from [**Article 94**](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P18-#pr94-)of the *Constitution of the Republic of Singapore*.

### Fundamental statements

The JUDICIAL POWER of the state can be vested only in the `Supreme court` and `Subordinate courts`.

#### But why? 

* Courts have certain features that make them appropriate for exercising judicial power.
* Courts authoratively state what the facts are, and apply the law to the facts.
    1. REALITY and APPEARANCE of **decisional independence** and **impartiality**
    2. application of PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS
    3. adherence *(as a general rule)* to the OPEN COURT PRINCIPLE
        * Singapore Law Report
        * Members of the public are *(generallY)* open to the public
    4. provision of reasons for the court's decisions

### Looking at the terms...

1. `Supreme court`
    * Greatest amount of jurisdiction and authority over a given matter.
    * Comprises...
        1. `HIGH COURT`
            * `General Division` *(unlimited jurisdiction to hear and rule on ANY dispute)*
                * `Family Division`
                * `Singapore International Commercial Court`
            * `Appellate Division` *(hears certain appeals from the General Division)*
        2. `COURT OF APPEAL`
            * Deals with the more complex questions regarding the law

2. `Subordinate court`
    * Limited jurisidiction and authority over certain matters.
    * Comprises...
        1. `STATE COURTS`
            * `District courts`
            * `Magistrates' courts`
            * `Coroners' courts`
            * `Small Claims Tribunals`
            * `Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals`
            * `Employment Claims Tribunals`
        2. `FAMILY JUSTICE COURTS`
            * `Family courts`
            * `Youth courts`
        3. `SYARIAH COURT`
        4. `OTHER COURTS`
            * Subordinate Military courts
            * Military court of appeal

#### Why so many types of courts?

* Judges have ***greater specialisation*** regarding hearing and deciding cases.
* `System of appeals`: Many issues of Subordinate courts can be brought to higher courts for appeal *(especially the more complex ones)*.
* `System of BINDING PRECEDENT`: higher courts bind lower courts decision-wise.
