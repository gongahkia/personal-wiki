## Learning Objective and Questions
**Objective**: Understand how to *find relevant statutes*, *read and understand them*, and *apply them to facts*.
**Questions**:
1. What is ==legislation== and how is it different from the ==common law==?
	* **Legislation** *(statutes)* are WRITTEN laws that are passed by the Legislature (parliament), vetted by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PRMC) and assented by the President.
	* **Common law** refers to the general conception of law, that is UNWRITTEN but understood and upheld by Courts. Rulings on cases that **can't be decided via legislation** will be decided on using the judiciary's understanding of Common law, and this understanding continues to be developed as cases are ruled upon. While Judge's are not required to follow Common Law via *Stare Decisis* (law of binding precedence), it influences their decisions to a large degree.
    
2. What is the difference between the ==Constitution== and ==other legislation==?
	* The **Constitution** defines guidelines and parameters which detail how the state and its governing entities should be constituted, as well as the rights of Singaporean citizens. Separation of powers under the 3-branch structure of the Judiciary, Executive and Legislation is enshrined in the constitution.
	* Unlike normal legislation *(primary/secondary)*, it cannot be amended as easily, and requires the passing of a Constitution Amendment Bill that has the support of more than 2/3 members of Parliament.
    
3. How do you interpret and apply ==legislation==?
	* That requires an understanding of legal terminology, as well as an implicit awareness and understanding of the common law of Singapore.
    
4. What are the practical things you should always do when applying ==legislation==?
	* Ensure that any application of legislation does not conflict with any other mentioned legislation.

## Ian Chai's tips
* To ==check for understanding== of a concept, see if you can DUMB IT DOWN and explain it **intuitively** to a laymen. If you can do it, you understand the concept.
* Everyone should learn to use ==GPT== as a tool to upgrade your learning. The more technical expertise you have, the better able you'll be able to see through GPT's bullshit.
## Definitions
* ==*Supermajority*==: Supermajority will be HIGHER than a Simple Majority. It entails a LARGER THAN NORMAL proportion of support from the **census population** (==MORE THAN 2/3 SUPPORT==, normally between 67%-90%).
* ==*Simple Majority*==: Support by more than half (51%) of a **census population** of members present and voting.
* ==*Legal Positivism*==: Philosophy of law that believes law is SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED, and should/should aim to encourage **positive norms** in society, encouraged by ==common law==.
* ==*Constitutional Supremacy*==: Enshrined in Article 4 of the **Constitution of the Republic of Singapore**.
* ==*Parliamentary Sovereignty*==: Parliament is the SUPREME LEGAL AUTHORITY in the UK, allowing them to **create or end** any law. Courts CANNOT overrule its legislation and no Parliament can PASS laws that future Parliaments CANNOT CHANGE. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution.
> Parliamentary Sovereignty and Constitutional Supremacy are two **opposing forces** (different systems of thinking about the law).
## Life cycle of a law on generative AI
### What is GPT?
* In laymen's terms, ==GENERATIVE AI==.
* **Large language based-learning model** developed using GPT-3.5 TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE. 
	* *Transformer architecture*: ==Non-sequential== NEURAL NETWORK designed for **processing sequences of data**, like sentences in natural language
#### Characteristics of GPT
1. ==*Generative*==: Model is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
	* Take a piece of text as **input** and predict what should come next, effectively creating human-like responses or completions.
2. ==*Pre-trained*==: Model exposed to LARGE DATASETS *(text from the internet)* using **reinforcement learning** provided by human feedback
	* 570GB of internet-sourced data
	* Fed 175 billion parameters 
	* Learn patterns, grammar, and the nuances of language usage. 
	* Learns to understand context, semantics, and cultural references.
	* *Word masking*: Equivalent to the **close passage** in Primary School English exams.
3. ==*Chat bot*==: The application of this GPT model. 
	* Catered to provide **interactive conversations** with users. 

### 'But for' causation
* **"If not for"** ==CAUSE==, there would have not been an ==EFFECT==.
	* *Judea Paul*: Generative AI cannot yet explain 'But for' causation properly.

## Statutes
* AKA ==Legislation== or ==Acts of Parliament==.

## Constitution
==**Constitutional Supremacy**==
* Enshrined in Article 4 of the **Constitution of the Republic of Singapore**.
* Any statutes *(legislation)* that contradict the core tenants laid out in the Constitution are deemed immoral, barring certain exceptions.
==**Parliamentary Sovereignty**==
* Effectively the idea that the Parliament is the chief law-making authority in a Judicial system.
* *"Parliament is the SUPREME LEGAL AUTHORITY in the UK, allowing them to **create or end** any law. Courts CANNOT overrule its legislation and no Parliament can PASS laws that future Parliaments CANNOT CHANGE. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution."*
### Looking @ the Constitution
Refer to the [Constitution of the Republic of Singapore](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963).
1. `Article 8`: **NO AMENDMENT TO THIS PART EXCEPT BY REFERENDUM**
	* For ==AMENDMENT of **Article 6,7,8**== *(Part 3 of Constitution)*, a National Referendum with 2/3 support of the census population is required
		* Otherwise, refer back to the rule regarding amendment of constitution where the ==Constitutional Amendment Act== needs to be passed with support of more than 2/3 member of parliament *(Supermajority)*.
  * AMENDMENT covers *additions* and *repeals*.
2. `Article 4`: **SUPREMACY OF CONSTITUTION**
	* Enshrines ==Constitutional Supremacy== within the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore
3. `Article 162`: **EXISTING LAWS**
	* All existing and future Statutes *(Legislation, Acts of Parliament)* shall be enforced by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, ==and SHOULD conform to the Constitution==.
### Constitutional supremacy vs Parliamentary sovereignty
Singapore adheres to ==constitutional supremacy==.
* Acts of parliament are beholden to...
	* Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR)
	* President's assent
		 * If President vetos a given Act of Parliament (legislation, statute), it returns to the Presidential Council for reconsideration.
	* Needs to adhere to the **core tenants** of the ==Constitution of the Republic of Singapore==.

### Statutory interpretation 
So how exactly do we go about reading, understanding and applying Statutes?

1. Read the STATUTE.
2. Take the **PURPOSIVE approach**.
	* **Interpretation act 9A(1)**
		* *"In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, ==an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not)== is to be **preferred** to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object."*
3. You are trying to find **Parliament's intent**, NOT the **Minister's intent**.
4. Use OUTSIDE *(extrinsic)* materials to determine the ==PURPOSE of the statute==.
5. CANONS OF CONSTRUCTION:
	* *Ejusdem generis*: the general gives way to the specific
	* *Lex nil furstra facit*: the law does nothing in vain, to avoid absurd results
	* **Domestic laws** consistent with **international obligations** 
	* Presumption against removal of *common law rights*
		* **General adherence to Common Law** *(unless there is a convincing argument to be made)*
6. Check to whom the Statute applies. *(TARGET AUDIENCE)*
7. Ensure *VERSION* of Statute being used was applied at the time of the events you are analysing.
8. Check understanding of what the words mean.
	* Refer to the ==*interpretation section*== near the start of the statute.
	* Can also refer to ==Interpretation Act== and ==Common Law==

## Problem Question
### Response
#### Offences committed 
##### Accused (butler)
1. ==Criminal Trespass==
	* Accused was not on duty on the night he stole the candles.
	* *`Penal Code 1871 (441)`
2. ==Theft==
	* Accused took the candles when he was not on duty, technically resulting in him taking the candles from B (possession and responsibility over them) without B's consent
	* `Penal Code 1871 (378)`
3. ==Absconding on Bail==
	* Accused did not wait to be charged, and fled Singapore while on bail, thus breaking the conditions of bail.
	* `Penal Code 1871 (103)`
##### Mr L (lawyer)
1. ==Conduct of proceedings in client's interest==
	* Lawyer lied to client to and intervened with the due law process.
	* `Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2a,i,j
##### B (butler, Accused's friend)
1. ==Criminal breach of trust==
	* B allowed the accused to enter the Victim's property when it was not the accused's shift.
	* B talked with the accused for 1hr, thus neglecting their duty.
	* B allowed the accused to be unsupervised in the same space, compounding the neglect of duty.
	* `Penal Code 1871 (405)`
#### FUA for Police
* Add more here

#### More information required?
1. Was the accused contractually allowed to be on the premises of the Victim when he was not on duty?
	* This affects whether Accused was trespassing
	* This affects whether B had criminal breach of trust
2. Was B's chatting with the Accused for 1hr considered a neglect of duty?
	* This affects whether B had criminal breach of trust
