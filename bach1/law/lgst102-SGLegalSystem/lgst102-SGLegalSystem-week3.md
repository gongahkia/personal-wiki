> FUA: Add additional notes under Statutory Interpretation from Wk3 elearn slides
## Learning Objective and Questions

**Objective**: Understand how to *find relevant statutes*, *read and understand them*, and *apply them to facts*.

**Questions**:

1. What is ==legislation== and how is it different from the ==common law==?
	* **Legislation** *(statutes)* are WRITTEN laws that are passed by the Legislature (parliament), vetted by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PRMC) and assented by the President.
	* **Common law** refers to the general conception of law, that is UNWRITTEN but understood and upheld by Courts. Rulings on cases that **can't be decided via legislation** will be decided on using the judiciary's understanding of Common law, and this understanding continues to be developed as cases are ruled upon. While Judge's are not required to follow Common Law via *Stare Decisis* (law of binding precedence), it influences their decisions to a large degree.
    
2. What is the difference between the ==Constitution== and ==other legislation==?
	* The **Constitution** defines guidelines and parameters which detail how the state and its governing entities should be constituted, as well as the rights of Singaporean citizens. Separation of powers under the 3-branch structure of the Judiciary, Executive and Legislation is enshrined in the constitution.
	* Unlike other legislation, it cannot be amended as easily, and requires the passing of a Constitution Amendment Bill that has the support of more than 2/3 members of Parliament.
    
3. How do you interpret and apply ==legislation==?
	* That requires an understanding of legal terminology, as well as an implicit awareness and understanding of the common law of Singapore.
    
4. What are the practical things you should always do when applying ==legislation==?
	* Ensure that any application of legislation does not conflict with any other mentioned legislation.

## Ian Chai's tips
* To ==check for understanding== of a concept, see if you can DUMB IT DOWN and explain it **intuitively** to a laymen. If you can do it, you understand the concept.

## Definitions
> FUA: 
>* Add what the difference between super majority and simple majority. Use GPT?
>* Add definitions of Parliamentary sovereignty
>* Add definitions of Legal Positivism

==*Super majority*==: Any fraction of support where the percentage of support is greater than one-half of support. 
==*Simple majority*==: Support by more than half, or 51%, of members present and voting. 
==*Constitutional Supremacy*==: Enshrined in Article 4 of the **Constitution of the Republic of Singapore**.
==*Parliamentary Sovereignty*==: Parliament is the SUPREME LEGAL AUTHORITY in the UK, allowing them to **create or end** any law. Courts CANNOT overrule its legislation and no Parliament can PASS laws that future Parliaments CANNOT CHANGE. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution.
> Parliamentary Sovereignty and Constitutional Supremacy are two **opposing forces** (different systems of thinking about the law).
## Life cycle of a law on generative AI
> *Ian Chai*: Everyone should learn to use GPT as a tool to upgrade your learning. The more technical expertise you have, the better able you'll be able to see through GPT's bullshit.
### What is GPT?
* In laymen's terms, ==GENERATIVE AI==.
* **Large language based-learning model** developed using GPT-3.5 TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE. 
	* *Transformer architecture*: ==Non-sequential== NEURAL NETWORK designed for **processing sequences of data**, like sentences in natural language
#### Characteristics of GPT
1. ==*Generative*==: Model is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
	* Take a piece of text as **input** and predict what should come next, effectively creating human-like responses or completions.
2. ==*Pre-trained*==: Model exposed to LARGE DATASETS *(text from the internet)* using **reinforcement learning** provided by human feedback
	* 570GB of internet-sourced data
	* Fed 175 billion parameters 
	* Learn patterns, grammar, and the nuances of language usage. 
	* Learns to understand context, semantics, and cultural references.
	* *Word masking*: Equivalent to the **close passage** in Primary School English exams.
3. ==*Chat bot*==: The application of this GPT model. 
	* Catered to provide **interactive conversations** with users.

### 'But for' causation
* **"If not for"** ==CAUSE==, there would have not been an ==EFFECT==.
	* *Judea Paul*: Generative AI cannot yet explain 'But for' causation properly.

## Statutes
* AKA ==Legislation== or ==Acts of Parliament==.

## Constitution
> Add in standard definition of parliamentary sovereignty
==**Constitutional Supremacy**==
* Enshrined in Article 4 of the **Constitution of the Republic of Singapore**.
* Any statutes *(legislation)* that contradict the core tenants laid out in the Constitution are deemed immoral, barring certain exceptions.
==**Parliamentary Sovereignty**==
* 
### Breaking down the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore
> Add summary of Article 4 and 162 of Constitution as well.
1. `Article 8`: **NO AMENDMENT TO THIS PART EXCEPT BY REFERENDUM**
	* Applies to the **amendment of article 6,7,8** wherein it requires a national referendum that has 2/3 support of the electoral group.
	* Otherwise, refer back to the rule regarding amendment of constitution where the ==Constitutional Amendment Act== needs to be passed with support of more than 2/3 member of parliament *(Supermajority)*.
2. `Article 4`: **SUPREMACY OF CONSTITUTION**
	*
3. `Article 162`: **EXISTING LAWS**
	*

### Constitutional supremacy vs Parliamentary sovereignty
Singapore adheres to ==constitutional supremacy==.
* Acts of parliament are beholden to...
	* Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR)
	* President's assent
		 * If President is to veto a given Act of Parliament (legislation, statute), it returns to the Presidential Council for reconsideration.
	* Needs to adhere to the **core tenants** of the ==Constitution of the Republic of Singapore==.

### Statutory interpretation 
1. Start with the text
2. Take the **PURPOSIVE approach**.
	* Refer to the interpretation act 9A(1)
> FUA: Add the definition of purposive approach here
3. You are trying to find **Parliament's intent**, NOT the **Minister's intent**.
4. CANONS OF CONSTRUCTION:
> FUA: Add translation of the following terms from latin
	* *Ejusdem generis*: 
	* *Lex nil furstra facit*: 
	* **Domestic laws** ==consistent with== **international obligations** 
	* Presumption against removal of ==common law rights==
		* **General adherence to Common Law** *(unless there is a convincing argument to be made)*
5. Check to whom the Statute applies. *(TARGET AUDIENCE)*
6. Check the relevant *VERSION* applied AT THE TIME of the events being analysed
7. Check understanding of what the words mean, there is usually an interpretation section at the start of the statute.
