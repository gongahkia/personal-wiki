## Learning Objective and Questions

**Objective**: Understand how to *find relevant statutes*, *read and understand them*, and *apply them to facts*.

**Questions**:

1. What is legislation and how is it different from the common law?
* **Legislation** *(statutes)* are WRITTEN laws that are passed by the Legislature (parliament), vetted by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PRMC) and assented by the President.
* **Common law** refers to the general conception of law, that is UNWRITTEN but understood and upheld by Courts. Rulings on cases that **can't be decided via legislation** will be decided on using the judiciary's understanding of Common law, and this understanding continues to be developed as cases are ruled upon. While Judge's are not required to follow Common Law via *Stare Decisis* (law of binding precedence), it influences their decisions to a large degree.
    
2. What is the difference between the Constitution and other legislation?
* The **Constitution** defines guidelines and parameters which detail how the state and its governing entities should be constituted, as well as the rights of Singaporean citizens. Separation of powers under the 3-branch structure of the Judiciary, Executive and Legislation is enshrined in the constitution.
* Unlike other legislation, it cannot be amended as easily, and requires the passing of a Constitution Amendment Bill that has the support of more than 2/3 members of Parliament.
    
3. How do you interpret and apply legislation?
* That requires an understanding of legal terminology, as well as an implicit awareness and understanding of the common law of Singapore.
    
4. What are the practical things you should always do when applying legislation?
* Ensure that any application of legislation does not conflict with any other mentioned legislation.
