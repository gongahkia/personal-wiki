### Response
#### Context
* I am prosecuting a case in a District Court *(State courts before a District judge)*
#### Actions
* To ***support my position***, I would...
	1. Find Case Law that saw **similar cases** of a ==cheating charge resulting in the sentence of imprisonment==, ruled in High Court or Court of Appeal.
	2. Find Case Law that saw **similar cases** of a ==cheating charge resulting in a sentence that was **NOT** a fine==, and the ==Judge's *ratio* covers why they chose not to sentence a fine== and instead chose the alternative, ruled in High Court or Court of Appeal.
* To ***counter the precedents cited by the Defence***, I would...
	1. For ==Case 1==, I would attack the *surrounding facts of the case*, in an attempt to weaken the correlation between said case and the current case in their *application of the common law* the Defence is attempting to invoke.
	2. For ==Cases 2 and 3==, I would attack whether the case was taken from a *higher, equivalent or lower UK court*. Additionally, Singapore has a different legal system from the UK *(autochthonous legal system)*, and so does not need to adhere strictly to such law.
	3. For ==Case 4==, I would argue that there is ==NO horizontal stare decisis *(law of binding precedence)*== since that case and the current case were both ruled in District Court, and so it has little bearing or persuasive power on the Judge's ruling.

### [Response](https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2016_SGHC_78)
#### Preliminary Definitions
* *Ratio*: Rationale for the judgement
* *Orbitor*: That which is said in passing
#### Ratio
1. Based on past precedent, the present case's sentence should be enhanced to 4 months’ imprisonment by ==taking into account== *the ==substantial amount misappropriated* and the *long period over which the misappropriation took place*==. 
	* *"Existing precedents set out above all also involved accused persons who pleaded guilty, made full restitution and had clean records. Even after taking into account these mitigating factors, a more appropriate sentence here would be 15 weeks’ imprisonment (equivalent of 4.36 weeks). A $4,000 fine is a marked and inconsistent departure from the precedents that is unjustified."*
2. District Judge placed ==**insufficient weight** on the two aggravating factors== *(substantial amount misappropriated, long period over which the misappropriation took place)*, and ==**too much weight** on the mitigating factors== *(Defendant’s clean record, plea of guilt, full restitution, difficult financial circumstances)*. 
	* Only in “rare” and “very exceptional or extreme circumstances” would an accused’s financial hardship be treated as a mitigating factor (Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10]). 
	* *"One cannot modify a sentence merely because the family will suffer."*
#### Orbitor
* Reflecting on the deterrence function of sentencing considerations in CBT cases.
	* *"Both specific and general deterrence are key sentencing considerations where Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) offences are concerned (see Tan Kim Hock Anthony v PP [2014] 2 SLR 795 at [43]). The $4,000 fine imposed for an offence involving a large sum of money is ==too lenient in light of the precedents, and would also fail to achieve the sentencing objective of deterrence==. I therefore allow the Prosecution’s appeal on sentence, and order that the Respondent’s sentence be enhanced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment instead."*
