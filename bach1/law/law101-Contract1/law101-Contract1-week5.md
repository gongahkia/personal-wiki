## Revision
Previously, we covered ==TERMS of a Contract==, wherein we discussed...
1. Statements made in negotiation (Express terms, Mere representation, Puff)
2. Express terms (Issue of incorporation, Parole Evidence Rule and EAC, Issue of interpretation and evidence to aid interpretation)
3. ==Implied terms== (Tests for implying)
4. Exception clauses (Issue of regulation)
Today, we'll be covering **implied terms** of a Contract.
## Definitions
*Implied terms*: IMPLIED expectations not necessarily written out, but nonetheless understood and expected.
## Types of Implied terms
* **Terms implied by COURT** via Common Law
	1. ==Adhoc Gap Fillers==: *Terms implied in fact*
	2. ==Default Rules==: *Terms implied in law*
* **Other methods**
	3. ==*Terms implied by Statute*==
	4. ==*Terms implied by Custom*==
* **Entire Agreement Clause** might exclude implied terms
