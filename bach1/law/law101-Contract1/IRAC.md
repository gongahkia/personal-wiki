## Practice question 1

### Premise:

One afternoon, Mr A (of A Ltd) telephones Mr B (of B Ltd) and offers to supply to B Ltd 100 reams of A4-sized Brand A 80gsm photocopier paper at $5.50 a ream. He informs Mr B that he may accept the offer via a facsimile message. Mr B finally gets around to sending the facsimile message (marked for the attention of Mr A) accepting A Ltd’s offer at 2 am. A Ltd’s office hours commence at 9 am. Mr A’s secretary typically arrives at 9 am but only starts work at 9.30 am after having her breakfast and refreshing her make-up. She checks the facsimile machine at 9.30 am and finds B Ltd’s facsimile message. She puts it in Mr A’s “in-tray” but Mr A does not see it until he arrives at the office at 10 am. Mr A usually goes for a round of golf before he comes into the office. When is a contract formed between the parties?

### Response:

1. **Identify legal issue**
    * When is the fax ACCEPTANCE effective?
2. **What legal rule to use**
    * GENERAL RECEIPT RULE 
3. **Apply legal rule**
* *ARGUMENT* for General Receipt Rule
    * This General Receipt Rule applies to instantaneous forms of communication.
    * Applying the General Receipt Rule as seen in `Enteres v Miles Far East`, we can see that acceptance is determined to be effective from 10am, after Mr A (the offeror) is actually notified of the acceptance of Mr B (the offeree).
* *COUNTER-ARGUMENT* to General Receipt Rule  
    * Lord Wilberforce's 3 factors
        1. `Brinkibon v Stahag Stahl`
            * Intention of the parties
            * Sound business practice
            * Making a judgement on where the risks should lie
4. **Conclusion**
    * Variants to the case
        * Acceptance sent OUTSIDE OFFICE HOURS
        * Notification of acceptance was received by a NON-PRINCIPAL PARTY

### Premise:

* Amy sells mangoes at a local wet market. She has a box of 10 very ripe Pakistani mangoes. She sticks a sign on the box that says “Special offer - $10 for the whole box of Pakistani mangoes, as is. Cash and carry.” Belle is Amy’s regular customer and her family loves mangoes. Belle visits Amy’s  stall in the morning and notices the box of very ripe Pakistani mangoes. After checking the contents of the box, she tells Amy, “If you deliver this box of mangoes to my house between 1 and 4 pm today, I will pay you $11 for it. You have my address.” Amy replies, “Yes, I have your address but I don’t know. I’ll think about it.” Belle winks and says, “Well, if the mangoes are delivered, we have a deal.” At 2 pm, Amy finally makes up her mind to sell to Belle. Just after her stall assistant left to deliver the box of mangoes to Belle, Amy receives a telephone call from Belle saying she no longer wants the mangoes. Can Amy enforce a contract against Belle?
