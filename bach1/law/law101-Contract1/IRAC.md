## Offer and acceptance

### Practice question 1

#### Premise:
* One afternoon, Mr A (of A Ltd) telephones Mr B (of B Ltd) and offers to supply to B Ltd 100 reams of A4-sized Brand A 80gsm photocopier paper at $5.50 a ream. He informs Mr B that he may accept the offer via a facsimile message. Mr B finally gets around to sending the facsimile message (marked for the attention of Mr A) accepting A Ltd’s offer at 2 am. A Ltd’s office hours commence at 9 am. Mr A’s secretary typically arrives at 9 am but only starts work at 9.30 am after having her breakfast and refreshing her make-up. She checks the facsimile machine at 9.30 am and finds B Ltd’s facsimile message. She puts it in Mr A’s “in-tray” but Mr A does not see it until he arrives at the office at 10 am. Mr A usually goes for a round of golf before he comes into the office. When is a contract formed between the parties?

### Response:
1. **Identify legal issue**
    * When is the fax ACCEPTANCE effective?
2. **What legal rule to use**
    * GENERAL RECEIPT RULE 
3. **Apply legal rule**
* *ARGUMENT* for General Receipt Rule
    * This General Receipt Rule applies to instantaneous forms of communication.
    * Applying the General Receipt Rule as seen in `Enteres v Miles Far East`, we can see that acceptance is determined to be effective from 10am, after Mr A (the offeror) is actually notified of the acceptance of Mr B (the offeree).
* *COUNTER-ARGUMENT* to General Receipt Rule  
    * Lord Wilberforce's 3 factors
        1. `Brinkibon v Stahag Stahl`
            * Intention of the parties
            * Sound business practice
            * Making a judgement on where the risks should lie
4. **Conclusion**
    * Variants to the case
        * Acceptance sent OUTSIDE OFFICE HOURS
        * Notification of acceptance was received by a NON-PRINCIPAL PARTY

### Practice question 2

#### Premise:
* Amy sells mangoes at a local wet market. She has a box of 10 very ripe Pakistani mangoes. She sticks a sign on the box that says “Special offer - $10 for the whole box of Pakistani mangoes, as is. Cash and carry.” Belle is Amy’s regular customer and her family loves mangoes. Belle visits Amy’s  stall in the morning and notices the box of very ripe Pakistani mangoes. After checking the contents of the box, she tells Amy, “If you deliver this box of mangoes to my house between 1 and 4 pm today, I will pay you $11 for it. You have my address.” Amy replies, “Yes, I have your address but I don’t know. I’ll think about it.” Belle winks and says, “Well, if the mangoes are delivered, we have a deal.” At 2 pm, Amy finally makes up her mind to sell to Belle. Just after her stall assistant left to deliver the box of mangoes to Belle, Amy receives a telephone call from Belle saying she no longer wants the mangoes. Can Amy enforce a contract against Belle?

## Certainty and Completeness
### Practice question 1

#### Premise:
* Ang engages Beng to construct a house for him. They sign a “letter of intent” that is expressly subject to contract. There was no price agreed in the letter of intent.

Instead, Beng starts building the house that Ang asked of him; indeed, Ang approves of Beng’s construction plans, material costs and also grants him access to the land where the house was to be constructed. Ang has also paid Beng some money for the materials used. After Beng completed half of the house, Ang refused to pay. Advise Beng.

## Consideration
### Practice question 1

#### Premise:
* Ann is planning to start a blogshop of original fashion designs. Ann’s father promises to let Ann have his Lenovo laptop for $1. The next day, he promises to lend Ann $2,000 interest-free for a year if she promises not to neglect her mother after she starts her business. However, when Ann’s mother hears about the deals, she makes a big fuss as she is against the idea of Ann leaving her full-time job to start a blogshop. Ann’s father tells Ann that the deals are off. Can Ann enforce her father’s promises? 

#### Response:
1. Identify legal issue
	* Whether Ann is able to enforce her father's promise to let her have his laptop for $1, as well as a $2,000 interest-free loan for a year.
2. What legal rule to use
	* Sufficiency of Consideration in the case of moral obligation.
3. Apply legal rule
	* For Ann to be able to enforce her father's promise against her, she must be able to prove that she was providing sufficient consideration as the Promisee, in her case to not neglect her mother after she starts her business.
	* Since such a promise to not neglect her mother is not an act that holds any economic value, it is hard to enforce, especially since it includes future actions on the Promisee's part. Additionally, such acts of filial piety are moral obligations, and as seen in `White v Bluett`, Courts generally deem such cases **INSUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION**.
4. Conclusion
	* Ann lacked sufficient consideration on her part to enforce her father's promise against her.

### Practice question 2

#### Premise:
* Bonnie, a fashion design student, agrees to let Ann have 10 of her original dress designs at $15 per design. Ann looks through Bonnie’s portfolio, chooses 10 designs and hands Bonnie $150. However, Bonnie calls Ann the next day and says that she feels she has asked too little for her original designs. She refuses to email the designs to Ann (as previously agreed) unless Ann pays $30 per design. Ann really likes Bonnie’s designs and is eager to gather as many original designs for her shop as possible before starting her shop. She agrees to pay the new price and Bonnie emails the designs to her. Ann’s brother jeers at Ann’s lack of business acumen when he hears about this. Ann now refuses to pay Bonnie a cent more. Can Bonnie enforce Ann’s promise to pay $30 per design?
