# Summary of the readings  

## `Offer and Acceptance`

* Offeror and Oferee in a contract
* Oferror validly communicated offer to the Oferee
* Oferee validly communicated acceptance (if any) to Oferror
* Ascertain if Offer has been withdrawn or Offer has expired before it can be accepted

Promisor objectivity approach
* Understand what the promisor objectively understood his promise to mean to the promisee, enforce the promise thus construed.

Promisee objectivity approach
* Consider what a reasonable person in the place of promisee might have understood the promiser to mean.

## `Conduct as evidence of objective intention to be bound`
* There must have been an intention to be bound.

## `Invitation to treat (as distinguished from an offer) does not constitute objective intention to be bound`

Returning to first principles... was the person trying to induce negotations, to induce offers, or to create an invitation to treat?

## `Rejection of offer`
* Counter-offer should be distinguished from a request for information
* Lapse of time
* Failure of a condition subject to which offer was made
* Lapse of time
* Death

## `Acceptance`
* An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.
