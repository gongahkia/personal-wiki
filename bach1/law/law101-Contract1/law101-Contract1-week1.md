`Contract`: Legally enforcable agreement
* Need not be in writing, have a signature, or be in conduct
* Formalises two-way accountability between Offerer and Offeree

> #### Statute law vs Case law
> * Statute law  
>   * Law created by the President || Parliment and enshrined in the statutes
> * Case law
>   * Common law, where courts defer to past decisions of higher courts *(stare decis)*

### `Objectivity`
* **Objective test**
    * Plaintiff has to determine what a reasonable person OF THE SAME `BACKGROUND` and `STATUS` *(standing in place of the defendant)* have had an understanding of a given incident.
    * Types of approaches
        * **`Promisee objectivity approach`**
            * Consider what a reasonable person in the place of promisee might have understood the promiser to mean.
                * "*Would said reasonable person have followed the same line of reasoning or is there something felacious with the defendant's reasoning?*"  
        * **`Promisor objectivity approach`**
            * Understand what the promisor objectively understood his promise to mean to the promisee, enforce the promise thus construed.

### Definitions

### Eh is it even an Offer?

Ask these 3 questions.

1. Is there an **intention to be bound**?
    * `Offer`: Maker's proposal leads a reasonable recepient in the SAME POSITION as the RECEPIENT to believe that the maker has an intention to be bound *(ie OBJECTIVITY TEST)*
    * `Invitation to treat`: No, proposal ONLY leads a reasonable recepient in the same position to believe that maker is attempting to induce offers.
    * [Electronic Transactions Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/ETA2010) Section 14
        * **Intention to be bound** still required even in the new age of online adverisement 
2. Was the Offer **validly communicated**?
    * Offerror validly communicated offer to the Offeree
    * Offeree validly communicated acceptance (if any) to Oferror
3. Ascertain if **offer has been withdrawn** or **offer has expired** before it can be accepted

### Talking about Offers...

* Unilateral offer
    * *Performance of conditions is the ACCEPTANCE of the unilateral offer.*
    * Acceptance of a unilaterla offer 
    * It is possible to make unilateral offers to the world
    * `Carlill vs Carbolic Smokeball Company`
        * Courts applied the **objective approach**  
* Bilateral offer
    * Explicit exchange of promises
* Edge cases
    * `Tinn v Hoffman & Co`
        * No contract could be concluded in the situation of a cross-offer

Termination of offer

1. **Rejection of offer**
    * EXPRESSED
        * Word
        * Conduct
    * IMPLIED
    * Counter-offer IS NOT Request for information
        * Courts need to distinguish between the two to determine whether the original offer has been terminated
2. **Lapse of time**
    * deadline stated via EXPRESS PROVISION
        * eg. *"Offer valid for 10 more minutes"*
    * Otherwise, offer expires upon EXPIRY OF REASONABLE TIME
3. **Failure of a condition** subject to which offer was made
    * EXPRESSED
    * IMPLIED
        * `Financings Limited vs Stimson`
4. Death :c
    * If Offeree knows of Offeror's death, CANNOT ACCEPT
    * If Offeree doesn't know of Offeror's death, law is unclear but leans toward CAN ACCEPT if contract *not for personal service*
    * `Chia Kim Huay v Saw Shu Mawa Min Min [2012]`
        * Offeree's state can accept if offer is not personal to Offeree

### Acceptance
* An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.
