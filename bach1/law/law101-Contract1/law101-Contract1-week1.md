## Definitions 

* Statute law: *Written law passed by the Legislature*
    * eg. *`Electronic Transactions Act 2010 Section 14`*
* Case law: *Common law, Courts refer to past precedence and judicial authority to make current decisions (concept of Stare Decisis)*
    * eg. *`Chia Kim Huay v Saw Shu Mawa Min Min [2012]`*
* Offeror: *person making an offer*
* Offeree: *person receiving an offer*
* Estate: *people who take charge of all your assets/estate after you die*
* Contract: *Legally enforcable agreement* that need not be in writing, have a signature, or be seen via conduct
* Offer: *Legally binding contract where there is an intention by the Offeror to be bound should offer be accepted, and Offer must have been communicated to Offeree.*
* Acceptance: *A final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.*
* Battle of the Forms: Situation where 2 businesses are negotiating the terms of a contract and each party wants to contract on the basis of its own terms. The battle is often won by the party who fired the "LAST SHOT" *(the party who put forward terms and conditions that were not explicitly rejected by the recipient)*
    * UK application of the 'LAST SHOT' doctrine
        * `Butler Machine Tool`
    * Singapore's position on 'LAST SHOT' doctrine
        * `Gay Choon Ing at [61]-[63]`

## Contract law

* Note that while there are some *statutes* that relate to Contract law, due to the complexity of each case, most decisions in Contract law are arrived at using *Case law*.

> Therefore, in IRAC responses, a bulk of argumentation for Rule and Application should come from **Case law** (mentioning past cases that are of relevance), and **statutes** should be used to supplement the core argument.

## Objectivity test
* Plaintiff has to determine what a reasonable person OF THE SAME `BACKGROUND` and `STATUS` *(standing in place of the defendant)* would have understood of a given incident.
* 2 APPROACHES
    1. **`Promisee objectivity approach`**
        * Consider what a reasonable person in the place of promisee might have understood the promiser to mean.
            * "*Would said reasonable person have followed the same line of reasoning or is there something felacious with the defendant's reasoning?*"  
    2. **`Promisor objectivity approach`**
        * Understand what the promisor objectively understood his promise to mean to the promisee, enforce the promise thus construed.

## About Offer and Acceptance...

### Offer
* Offer: *Legally binding contract where there is an intention by the Offeror to be bound should offer be accepted, and Offer must have been communicated to Offeree.*

### Is this even an Offer?

To determine whether something is even an offer, ask these 3 questions.

#### 1. Is there an intention to be bound?
* `Intention to be bound`
* `Offer`: Maker's proposal leads a reasonable recepient in the SAME POSITION as the RECEPIENT to believe that the maker has an intention to be bound *(ie OBJECTIVITY TEST)*
* `Invitation to treat`/`Attempt to induce negotiations`: No, proposal ONLY leads a reasonable recepient in the same position to believe that maker is attempting to induce offers.
* [Electronic Transactions Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/ETA2010) Section 14
    * **Intention to be bound** still required even in the new age of online adverisement 

#### 2. Was the Offer validly communicated?
* Offerror validly communicated offer to the Offeree
* Offeree validly communicated acceptance (if any) to Oferror

#### 3. Ascertain if offer has been withdrawn or offer has expired before it can be accepted.

   F --> H[3. Was the offer withdrawn or did it expire before it could be accepted?]
   E --> G[:c]
   H --> I[Yes, VALID OFFER]
   H --> J[:c]
```

### Unilateral vs Bilateral offers

#### 1. Unilateral offer
* Performance of conditions is the ACCEPTANCE of the unilateral offer.
* It is possible to make unilateral offers to more than one person, perhaps to the entire world.
* `Carlill vs Carbolic Smokeball Company`
    * Courts applied the **objective approach** in determining whether Carbolic Smokeball Company could be held liable for Carlill's illness.

#### 2. Bilateral offer
* **Explicit exchange** of promises EXPRESSED clearly.
* Edge cases
* `Tinn v Hoffman & Co`
    * No contract could be concluded in the situation of a **cross-offer**.


### Termination of an offer

#### 1. Rejection of offer
* EXPRESSED
    * Word
    * Conduct
* IMPLIED
* Counter-offer IS NOT Request for information
    * Courts need to distinguish between the two to determine whether the original offer has been terminated

#### 2. Lapse of time
* deadline stated via EXPRESS PROVISION
    * eg. *"Offer valid for 10 more minutes"*
* Otherwise, offer expires upon EXPIRY OF REASONABLE TIME

#### 3. Failure of a condition subject to which offer was made
* EXPRESSED
* IMPLIED
    * `Financings Limited vs Stimson`

#### 4. Death
* If Offeree knows of Offeror's death, CANNOT ACCEPT
* If Offeree doesn't know of Offeror's death, law is unclear but leans toward CAN ACCEPT if contract *not for personal service*
* `Chia Kim Huay v Saw Shu Mawa Min Min [2012]`
    * Offeree's state can accept if offer is not personal to Offeree

#### 5. Withdrawing an offer
1.  **BILATERAL OFFERS**
    * Withdrawal must be initiated before ACCEPTANCE.
    * Withdrawal only VALID once Offeree is *aware of it*.
    * Can there be an implied revocation by a 3rd party related to the Offeror?
        * `Dickinson v Dodds`
            * Generally, yes, if the 3rd party is a RELIABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION.
            * In this case, the 3rd party was the Offeree's own agent and hence there is no problem with communication.

2. **UNILATERAL OFFER**
    > Law not settled in Singapore yet!
    * Can be withdrawn before COMPLETE PERFORMANCE of acceptance of the offer.
    * `Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd` 
        * ***2-OFFER ANALYSIS***
        * Unilateral offer creates 2 OFFERS
            1. EXPRESS OFFER
                * The offer you have "expressed"
            2. IMPLIED OFFER
                * Not mentioned but nevertheless intended by the Offeror
                * If you have started the PERFORMANCE of the Act, the Offeror will not do anything to impede the completion of said Act
    * `Errington v Errington & Woods`
        * **First and principal offer** is itself acceptance of the Offeree's commencement of performance

### Acceptance
* Acceptance: A **final and unqualified expression** of assent to the terms of an offer.

### Elements of Acceptance
#### 1. INTENTION TO BE BOUND determined OBJECTIVELY
* 'Intention to be bound' evaluated as by means of final and unqualified assent to the terms of the offer
* 'Objectively' determined via Objectivity test
    * **OBJECTIVITY TEST**: 
        * Take point of view of a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the offeror
