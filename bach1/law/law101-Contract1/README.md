## `I`ssue `R`ule `A`pplication `C`onclusion (IRAC) guide 

### 1. Identify the legal `I`ssue
* This step defines the “legal” problem raised by the given scenario. 
* Phrased according to the (relevant) facts in the scenario and the Rule or legal principle you are considering.  
    * *eg.* Is the advertisement on ABC’s website an `Offer` or `Invitation to treat`?
* A factual issue is not a legal issue.
    * *eg.* Whether ABC keyed in the wrong price of the printer in its website?

### 2. State the relevant `R`ule / legal principle
* This is the Rule/legal Principle that could provide an answer to the legal issue that was identified. 
* Rules/legal principles may be from cases **(CASE LAW)** or statutes **(STATUTE LAW)**.
    1. **Court Ruling on a case** (CASE LAW)
        * *eg.* `Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter`
        * *An offer “must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted”* 
    2. **Rule from a statute** (STATUTE LAW)
        * *eg.* `Section 14 of the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA)` 
        * *“a proposal to conclude a contract made through ...electronic communications which is not addressed to ...specific parties, but is generally accessible to parties making use of information systems, ...is to be considered as an invitation to make offers, unless it clearly indicates the intention of the party making the proposal to be bound in the case of acceptance.”*

### 3. `A`pply the law / rule to the given scenario.
* This is where you show how the Rule/legal Principle applies to the facts of the scenario.  
* CASE LAW
    * **Explain clearly** why the scenario facts satisfy the requirements of the rule.  
    * **Consider** how Courts reasoned and applied each requirement of the rule to determine if a given scenario fits it.
        * *eg.* Consider the rule that an offer is made if a proposal would lead a REASONABLE PERSON receiving the proposal to think that the proposal maker has an `intention to be bound` if the proposal terms are accepted. 
            * Several court decisions have ruled that certain factors are relevant to decide whether a reasonable person would be so led *(eg, out-of-stock argument, language used in the proposal as objectively understood)*. 
            * You should consider these factors and how the court reasoned in applying the factors. 
            * You should explain how those factors apply to the given fact scenario and the likely conclusion they lead to. 
            * In applying the “language used” factor, you should point out the exact words or phrases of the proposal and what a reasonable understanding of those words or phrases is, to explain why they would (or would not) lead a reasonable person to think that the web-shop owner had an intention to be bound.

* STATUTE LAW  
    * **Discuss whether** the facts of given scenario satisfy the *elements of the statutory provision*. 

### 4. `C`onclusion

* State the conclusion that your application of the rules to the scenario facts has led to.
    * *eg.* “It is likely that the advertisement on ABC’s website is an offer.”

> * As you deal with each successive issue in a logical sequence, you will come to several mini-conclusions before you draw your overall conclusion. 
> * *eg.* Overall legal issue is “Is A liable to B for breach of contract?”   
>   * Facts of the case require us to consider...
>       * 1. Was the advertisement an offer or invitation to treat? 
>       * 2. If it was an offer, was there a valid acceptance? 
>       * 3. You need to come to your mini-conclusions on Issues 1 and 2 before you can reach a conclusion on the overall issue.
