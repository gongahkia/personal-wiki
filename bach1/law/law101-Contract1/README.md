## `I`ssue `R`ule `A`pplication `C`onclusion (IRAC) guide 

### Note...

> * You DO NOT have to summarise the scenario, provide an introduction or explain why you have identified particular legal issues before you start analysing. Just begin your written analysis using IRAC.
> * Follow the IRAC structure for every legal issue, complete the steps for one issue before you move on to the next issue.

### 1. Identify the legal `I`ssue
* This step defines the “legal” problem raised by the given scenario. The legal issue is phrased according to the (relevant) facts in the scenario and the rule or legal principle you are considering.
    * *eg.* Issue 1: Is the advertisement on ABC’s website an offer or invitation to treat?

> * Note that a factual issue is not a legal issue. An example of a factual issue is: Whether ABC keyed in the wrong price of the printer in its website?

### 2. State the relevant `R`ule / legal principle
* This is the rule/legal principle that could provide an answer to the legal issue that was identified. Rules/legal principles may be from cases (court decisions) or statutes, or any appropriate authority.
    * *eg.* Rule from a case (court decision): An offer “must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted” (Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter).
    * *eg.* Rule from a statute: Section 14 of the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) states that “a proposal to conclude a contract made through ...electronic communications which is not addressed to ...specific parties, but is generally accessible to parties making use of information systems, ...is to be considered as an invitation to make offers, unless it clearly indicates the intention of the party making the proposal to be bound in the case of acceptance.”

### 3. `A`pply the law / rule to the given scenario.
* This is where you show how the rule/legal principle applies to the facts of the scenario. Do this step-by-step as you would to someone who is uninformed.
    * *Applying the rule:* you must explain clearly whether the scenario facts satisfy the requirements of the rule. 
        * *eg.* Consider the rule that an offer is made if a proposal would lead a reasonable person receiving the proposal to think that the proposal maker has an intention to be bound if the proposal terms are accepted. Several court decisions have ruled that certain factors are relevant to decide whether a reasonable person would be so led *(eg, out-of-stock argument, language used in the proposal as objectively understood, etc)*. You should consider these factors and how the court reasoned in applying the factors. You should explain how those factors apply to the given fact scenario and the likely conclusion they lead to. For example, in applying the “language used” factor, you should point out the exact words or phrases of the proposal and what a reasonable understanding of those words or phrases is, to explain why they would (or would not) lead a reasonable person to think that the web-shop owner had an intention to be bound. **Remember to explain the application of rules step-by-step as you would to an uninformed reader.**
> * In applying a rule from a case (court decision), sometimes it is useful to compare the facts of that court case with the facts of the given scenario, to either highlight important similarities to justify the same application of the rule or highlight important differences to argue that the rule should not apply to the given scenario.
> * You should discuss if the reasoning behind the rule is appropriate to your scenario. For example, would the reasoning behind the “out-of-stock” argument be relevant where the proposal maker sells stock that are limitless in supply?

*Applying a rule from a statute:* you should discuss whether the facts of given scenario satisfy the elements of the statutory provision. Recalling Section 14 of the ETA, you will have to explain if the scenario facts meet the elements of:  
* a proposal to conclude a contract  
* made through ...electronic communications  
* which is not addressed to ...specific parties,  
* but is generally accessible to parties making use of information systems  
* clearly indicates (or does not indicate) the intention of the party making the proposal to be bound in the case of acceptance  
> * Note that the last element in s14 ETA echoes the rule stated by court decisions – that the existence or absence of an intention to be bound by the proposal maker is pivotal to whether the proposal is an offer.

### 4. `C`onclusion

* State the conclusion that your application of the rules to the scenario facts has led to.
    * *eg.* “It is likely that the advertisement on ABC’s website is an offer.”

> * As you deal with each successive issue in a logical sequence, you will come to several mini-conclusions before you draw your overall conclusion. For example, the overall legal issue may be “Is A liable to B for breach of contract?” But to answer this overall issue, the facts of the case may require us to consider the legal issues of (1) Was the advertisement an offer or invitation to treat? (2) If it was an offer, was there a valid acceptance? In such a case, you need to come to your mini-conclusions on Issues (1) and (2) before you can reach a conclusion on the Overall Issue.
