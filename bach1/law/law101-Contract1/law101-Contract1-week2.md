## Definitions

Vitiate: *destroy the integrity of a given contract*

## Uncertainty
* A term is uncertain if it is **incomprehensible**.

## Incompleteness
* A contract is incomplete if it **lacks material terms**.

### Effect of Uncertainty and Incompleteness
* `Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd`
    * *Unless all the material terms of the contract are agreed there is no binding agreement*.  
    * An agreement to agree in future is NOT a contract, nor is there a contract if a material term is NEITHER SETTLED NOR IMPLIED by law and the document contains **no machinery for ascertaining it**.

* `Norwest Holdings (High Court) at [28]`
    1. *Cases such as `May and Butcher, Limited v The King [1934] 2 KB 17` illustrate that an agreement will NOT BE regarded as a **binding contract** if essential matters*, without which the contract is too uncertain or incomplete to be workable, *remain to be agreed upon.*
    2. *What is required is **substantial or essential AGREEMENT** and NOT complete agreement*
    3. *A contract may be regarded as having been formed even though it has not been worked out in meticulous detail.* 
    4. *Similarly if a contract calls for further agreement between the parties, the absence of further agreement between the parties will vitiate the contract only if it makes it unworkable or void for uncertainty.*
        > 1 and 3 seem to conflict with each other.
