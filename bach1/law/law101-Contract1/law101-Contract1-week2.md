## Definitions

Vitiate: *destroy the integrity of a given contract*

### Uncertainty
* A term is uncertain if it is **incomprehensible**.

### Incompleteness
* A contract is incomplete if it **lacks material terms**.

### Effect of UNCERTAINITY and INCOMPLETENESS  
* `Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd`
    * *Unless all the material terms of the contract are agreed there is no binding agreement*.  
    * An agreement to agree in future is NOT a contract, nor is there a contract if a material term is NEITHER SETTLED NOR IMPLIED by law and the document contains **no machinery for ascertaining it**.

* `Norwest Holdings (High Court) at [28]`
    1. *Cases such as `May and Butcher, Limited v The King [1934] 2 KB 17` illustrate that an agreement will NOT BE regarded as a **binding contract** if essential matters*, without which the contract is too uncertain or incomplete to be workable, *remain to be agreed upon.*
    2. *What is required is **substantial or essential AGREEMENT** and NOT complete agreement*
    3. *A contract may be regarded as having been formed even though it has not been worked out in meticulous detail.* 
    4. *Similarly if a contract calls for further agreement between the parties, the absence of further agreement between the parties will vitiate the contract only if it makes it unworkable or void for uncertainty.*

## Agreements to negotiate/agree in GOOD FAITH

* `Walford v Miles`
    * Case Summary:  
        > Add facts of the case here
    * Plaintiff argues...
        1. No contract was concluded between Plaintiff and Defendant.
        2. **LOCK-OUT** agreement, Defendant agreed NOT to enter into negotiations with any 3rd party
        3. **LOCK-IN** agreement, IMPLIED term of agreement that Defendant would *continue to negotiate in GOOD FAITH* with Plaintiff
    * Problems:
        * **LOCK-OUT** agreement
            * `Pitt v PHH Asset Management Ltd`
        * **LOCK-IN** agreement
            * Failed for UNCERTAINTY
    * Court Ruling:
        * No term specifying **DURATION** to negotiate in good faith
        * No **workable criterion** to ascertain if good faith has been exercised
        * Lord Ackner: 
            * **contradictary claim**, the very concept of negotiations implies that either party has FULL AUTONOMY and LICENSE to withdraw from the negotations at any time should they feel like doing so
            * *“an internal (and fatal) contradiction – the very nature of negotiations necessarily implied an adversarial scenario which was anathema to any concept of good faith and which entitled ‘either party ... to withdraw from [the] negotiations, at any time and for any reason.'”*
    * SG Court Rulings
        * `Sundercan Ltd v Salzman Anthony David [2010] (High Court) at [25]`
        * `HSBC Institutional Trust Services [2012] (Court of Appeal)`

## Agreements SUBJECT TO CONTRACT

* `Thomson Plaza (Pte) Ltd v Liquidators of Yaohan Department Store Singapore Pte Ltd`
    * Court Ruling:
        * Only a FORMAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT that is executed and exchanged between parties qualifies as a **contract**, and until then, there is no binding enforceable contract between them.
        * *‘... the expression “subject to contract” means that unless and until a formal written agreement has been executed and exchanged by the parties there is no binding and enforceable contract between them. That is so even if the parties are in agreement as to all the terms.’*
    * Counterarguments:
        1. `Norwest Court of Appeal at [24]`
            * Cannot just use whether "subject to contract" is included to determine if its a BINDING CONTRACT, must look at **other contextual information** to understand the context within which the agreement was made.
            *  *‘whether there is a binding contract between the parties should be determined by considering all the circumstances, not just the inclusion of the stock phrase “subject to contract” (on the basis that the substance of the situation must always prevail) ... in some cases, even if some terms remain to be negotiated, it is possible for parties to have agreed to a contract despite the presence of a “subject to contract” clause'*
        2. Essential terms YET TO BE AGREED
            * `Norwest Holdings (High Court) at [28]`
                * An agreement is NOT a BINDING CONTRACT if there is **non-agreement** on essential matters, without which the contract is too UNCERTAIN or INCOMPLETE to be workable
                * *"Cases such as `May and Butcher, Limited v The King [1934] 2 KB 17` illustrate that an agreement will not be regarded as a binding contract if essential matters, without which the contract is too uncertain or incomplete to be workable, remain to be agreed upon..."*
        3. Parties **behaved** as if "subject to contract" clause DID NOT MATTER
            * `RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v Molkerei Alois Muller GmbH & Co KG (UK Production)`
                * Case Summary:
                    * RTS began work on basis of letter of intent with "subject to contract" clause whilst parties were NEGOTIATING final contract
                * UK Court: 
                    * An agreement is a BINDING CONTRACT when parties **CONDUCT** displays there was a clear intention for a contractual relationship between them.
                    * *the ‘subject to contract’ clause had been waived by parties’ conduct, such as carrying out works, making payments, etc. It found that the parties intended that there was a contractual relationship between them.*

## Solutions to UNCERTAINITY and INCOMPLETENESS

### Purpose of curing Uncertainity and Incompleteness
* `Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [40]`
    * *"The function of the court is to try, as far as practical experience allows, to ensure that the reasonabale expecation of honest men are not disappointed"*

### How does a Court cure UNCERTAINTY and INCOMPLETENESS?

#### 1. Previous course of dealings, trade practice and reasonableness

* `Grossner Jens v Raffles Holdings Ltd`
    * Case Summary:
        > Add case summary here
    * Court Ruling:
        * `Grossner Jens at [14]: ...in Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd ... at 13`
            * *"unless all the material terms of the contract are agreed there is NO binding obligation"*
        * `Grossner Jens at [18]: ...i n Hillas & Co v Arcos Ltd (1932)`
            * SOME TERMS of the contract can be **inferrred from PREVIOUS TRANSACTIONS between said parties**
            * However, due to *insufficient deals between the 2 parties in this case*, there is no such implication
            * *" the House of Lords held that in the light of the previous dealings between the parties in question, some of the terms of the contract could be ascertained from previous transactions between the said parties and the custom of trade. However, there are insufficient deals between JG and Raffles to warrant any such implication."*

#### 2. Contract providing for method of ascertainment

Court could impose a workable mechanism.

* `Sudbrook Trading Estate Ltd`
    * Case Summary:
        * Lessees were granted option to purchase at price to be agreed by 2 valuers, one appointed by lessor, and the other by lessee. Lessor refused to appoint a valuer and so the mechanism for ascertaining price had broken down. Lessor argue that the contract was unenforceable for uncertainty.
    * Court Ruling:
        * Applying the OBJECTIVE principle, a REASONABLE bystander in the same position ...
        * *‘the agreement was for sale at a fair and reasonable price by the application of objective standards. Since price was to be ascertained by machinery which, on the true construction of the agreement was a subsidiary and non-essential part of the contract, the court would, if the machinery broke down for any reason, substitute its own machinery, to ascertain a fair and reasonable price'*
        > Add explantion for this, I have no idea what he's saying
* `Tan Yeow Khoon v Tan Yeow Tat [1998] 2 SLR(R) 19 at [36]`
    * Case Summary:
        > Add case summary here.
    * Court Ruling:
        * Courts have a responsiblity to ...
        * *"where there is a contract for sale at a valuation, the court ought to ... direct an inquiry to ascertain the price, not only where the parties fail to provide the machinery, but also where the machinery provided had broken down: provided of course that on the true construction of the contract the agreed machinery was subsidiary to the ascertainment of the proper price and was not of the essence of the agreement. The question whether the prescribed machinery was of the essence of the contract is a matter of construction"*

#### 3. Partial recovery in the absence of a contract

Compensating a **reasonable sum in restitution**

* `British Steel Corp v Cleveland Bridge & Engineering`
    * Court Ruling:
        * The law obligates the REQUESTING PARTY to make a payment of a **REASONABLE SUM** for the work done to the PERFORMING PARTY, as compliant to that request.
        * *"In my judgment the true analysis of the situation is simply this. Both parties confidently expected a formal contract to eventuate. In these circumstances, to expedite performance under that anticipated contract, one requested the other to commence the contract work, and the other complied with that request. If thereafter —as anticipated—a contract was entered into, the work done as requested will be treated as having been performed under that contract; if, contrary to their expectation, no contract was entered into, then the performance of the work is not referable to any contract of which the terms can be ascertained, and the law simply imposes an obligation on the party who made the request to pay a reasonable sum for such work as has been done pursuant to that request, such an obligation sounding in quasi-contract or, as we now say, in restitution. (Emphasis added.)"*

#### 4. Statutory provision
#### 5. Implication of Terms

### Intention to create legal relations

*Gay Choon Ing*: Connotes an **intention** on the part of both parties to a **purported contract that the transaction has legal effect**.
* While the intention to create legal relations is ascertained OBJECTIVELY, the law draws upon **presumptions depending on the circumstances**

#### Social and Domestic arrangements

1. `Balfour v Balfour`
    * Case Summary: 
        * The defendant husband promised his wife an allowance during his period of absence as a civil servant in Ceylon.
    * Court Ruling:
        * It is presumed that in domestic relations, parties do not NORMALLY seek out legal relations, and so the BURDEN OF PROOF lies on the Plaintiff to show that the parties intended for their arrangement to have **legal consequences**.
        * *'The small Courts of this country would have to be multiplied one hundred-fold if these arrangements were held to result in legal obligations. They are not sued upon, not because the parties are reluctant to enforce their legal rights when the agreement is broken, but because the parties, in the inception of the arrangement, never intended that they should be sued upon. Agreements such as these are outside the realm of contracts altogether. The common law does not regulate the form of agreements between spouses. Their promises are not sealed with seals and sealing wax. The consideration that really obtains for them is that natural love and affection which counts for so little in these cold Courts.’*

Singapore's position on Social and Domestic Arrangements

2. `Ong Wui Teck v Ong Wui Swoon [2019] SGCA 61 at [45]`
    * Court Ruling:
        * `Balfour`'s presumption applies across other familial relations as well.
        * *"The presumption in `Balfour` is not restricted only to arrangements between husbands and wives, but **applies also to other types of familial relationships, such as those involving parent and child, or between siblings**"*
        * *"We must emphasise that arrangements made in the domestic or social context merely give rise to a presumption that parties do not intend to create legal relations, which **puts the burden of proof on the party seeking to enforce the agreement to prove that parties did in fact intend for their arrangement to have legal consequences**."*
