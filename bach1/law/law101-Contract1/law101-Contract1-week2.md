## Definitions

Vitiate: *destroy the integrity of a given contract*

### Uncertainty
* A term is uncertain if it is **incomprehensible**.

### Incompleteness
* A contract is incomplete if it **lacks material terms**.

### Effect of UNCERTAINITY and INCOMPLETENESS  
* `Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd`
    * *Unless all the material terms of the contract are agreed there is no binding agreement*.  
    * An agreement to agree in future is NOT a contract, nor is there a contract if a material term is NEITHER SETTLED NOR IMPLIED by law and the document contains **no machinery for ascertaining it**.

* `Norwest Holdings (High Court) at [28]`
    1. *Cases such as `May and Butcher, Limited v The King [1934] 2 KB 17` illustrate that an agreement will NOT BE regarded as a **binding contract** if essential matters*, without which the contract is too uncertain or incomplete to be workable, *remain to be agreed upon.*
    2. *What is required is **substantial or essential AGREEMENT** and NOT complete agreement*
    3. *A contract may be regarded as having been formed even though it has not been worked out in meticulous detail.* 
    4. *Similarly if a contract calls for further agreement between the parties, the absence of further agreement between the parties will vitiate the contract only if it makes it unworkable or void for uncertainty.*

## Agreements to negotiate/agree in GOOD FAITH

* `Walford v Miles`
    * Case summary:  
        > Add facts of the case here
    * Plaintiff argues...
        1. No contract was concluded between Plaintiff and Defendant.
        2. **LOCK-OUT** agreement, Defendant agreed NOT to enter into negotiations with any 3rd party
        3. **LOCK-IN** agreement, IMPLIED term of agreement that Defendant would *continue to negotiate in GOOD FAITH* with Plaintiff
    * Problems:
        * **LOCK-OUT** agreement
            * `Pitt v PHH Asset Management Ltd`
        * **LOCK-IN** agreement
            * Failed for UNCERTAINTY
    * Court Ruling:
        * No term specifying **DURATION** to negotiate in good faith
        * No **workable criterion** to ascertain if good faith has been exercised
        * Lord Ackner: 
            * **contradictary claim**, the very concept of negotiations implies that either party has FULL AUTONOMY and LICENSE to withdraw from the negotations at any time should they feel like doing so
            * *“an internal (and fatal) contradiction – the very nature of negotiations necessarily implied an adversarial scenario which was anathema to any concept of good faith and which entitled ‘either party ... to withdraw from [the] negotiations, at any time and for any reason.'”*
    * SG Court Rulings
        * `Sundercan Ltd v Salzman Anthony David [2010] (High Court) at [25]`
        * `HSBC Institutional Trust Services [2012] (Court of Appeal)`

## Agreements SUBJECT TO CONTRACT

* `Thomson Plaza (Pte) Ltd v Liquidators of Yaohan Department Store Singapore Pte Ltd`
    * Court Ruling:
        * Only a FORMAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT that is executed and exchanged between parties qualifies as a **contract**, and until then, there is no binding enforceable contract between them.
        * *‘... the expression “subject to contract” means that unless and until a formal written agreement has been executed and exchanged by the parties there is no binding and enforceable contract between them. That is so even if the parties are in agreement as to all the terms.’*
    * Counterarguments:
        1. `Norwest Court of Appeal at [24]`
            * Cannot just use whether "subject to contract" is included to determine if its a BINDING CONTRACT, must look at **other contextual information** to understand the context within which the agreement was made.
            *  *‘whether there is a binding contract between the parties should be determined by considering all the circumstances, not just the inclusion of the stock phrase “subject to contract” (on the basis that the substance of the situation must always prevail) ... in some cases, even if some terms remain to be negotiated, it is possible for parties to have agreed to a contract despite the presence of a “subject to contract” clause'*
        2. Essential terms YET TO BE AGREED
            * `Norwest Holdings (High Court) at [28]`
                * An agreement is NOT a BINDING CONTRACT if there is **non-agreement** on essential matters, without which the contract is too UNCERTAIN or INCOMPLETE to be workable
                * *"Cases such as `May and Butcher, Limited v The King [1934] 2 KB 17` illustrate that an agreement will not be regarded as a binding contract if essential matters, without which the contract is too uncertain or incomplete to be workable, remain to be agreed upon..."*
        3. Parties **behaved** as if "subject to contract" clause DID NOT MATTER
            * `RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v Molkerei Alois Muller GmbH & Co KG (UK Production)`
                * Case Summary:
                    * RTS began work on basis of letter of intent with "subject to contract" clause whilst parties were NEGOTIATING final contract
                * UK Court: 
                    * An agreement is a BINDING CONTRACT when parties **CONDUCT** displays there was a clear intention for a contractual relationship between them.
                    * *the ‘subject to contract’ clause had been waived by parties’ conduct, such as carrying out works, making payments, etc. It found that the parties intended that there was a contractual relationship between them.*
