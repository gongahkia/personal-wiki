## Consideration
*Consideration*: Consideration signifies a RETURN *(recognised in law)* given in exchange for the PROMISE SOUGHT TO BE ENFORCED.
* The PROMISE, PERFORMANCE, FORBEARANCE bargained by the **PROMISOR**, provided by the **PROMISEE** in exchange for the PROMISOR's PROMISE.
	* Safeguards the PROMISER, who is providing the promise.
	* Consideration is provided by the PROMISEE.
* Based on the damn basic idea of reciprocity, an essential element of a Contract *(otherwise it's just considered a gift, not a Contract)*
* Without Consideration from the Promisee, there is an unequal weightage of stakes, and Contract CANNOT BE ENFORCEABLE.
* Comes in the form of RIGHT, INTEREST, PROFIT or BENEFIT to the Promisor, or FORBEARANCE, DETRIMENT, LOSS or RESPONSIBILITY suffered by the Promisee.

Fresh consideration required for variations to existing contracts *unless* expressly dispensed with by the contracting parties
* *`Ma Hongjin [36], [60]`

## Contracts by deed
*Contracts by deed*: Contracts that are **SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED** to create an EXPRESSED legal obligation.
* Consideration NOT REQUIRED for enforceability of Contracts by deed, since the legal obligation holds parties accountable in Court of Law.
* Contrasted with **Simple Contracts** *(the other IMPLICIT CONTRACTS)* covered in Week 1 and 2.

### Executory consideration
*Executory*: Consideration is a COUNTER-PROMISE

### Executed consideration
*Executed*: Consideration is an ACT

> FUA: Add more details on Executory and Executed consideration

## Benefit-detriment analysis
*Benefit-detriment analysis*: A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.
* Consideration is a BENEFIT conferred by the promisee on the **PROMISOR** in return for the *promisor’s promise*
* Consideration is also a DETRIMENT incurred/suffered by the **PROMISEE** in return for the *promisor’s promise*

> `Gay Choon Ing [67]`: *benefit-detriment is preferred as ‘the most workable of all the definitions*
## Price of Promise analysis
*Price of Promise analysis*: Promisee ‘buys’ the promisor’s promise by doing some act for it or by offering a counter-promise in return.

## Past consideration
*Past consideration*: Act that is done **prior to** and **independent of** a promise.
* By its very definition, past consideration CANNOT be regarded as a valid consideration.
	* VALID CONSIDERATION for a promise must be **causally related** to the promise itself.
	* Given in exchange for a promise.

### Exceptions to Past consideration being invalid
* An act done BEFORE the giving of a promise to **make a payment** or to **confer some benefit** can SOMETIMES be seen as Consideration for the promise.
#### The `Pao On` exception
* `Pao On v Lau Yiu Long`
	* Case Summary:
		 * Plaintiff Pao On signed a contract with a public company to sell ALL their shares in a private company.
		 * Under the contract, Plaintiff Pao On was to be paid with shares issued by the public company. 
		 * Defendant Lau Yiu Long were majority shareholders of the public company, and feared the heavy selling of public company stock by the Plaintiff Pao On would depress the public company's share price.
		* As such, Plaintiff Pao On also undertook **not to sell or transfer** 60% of the public company shares received until end April 1974.
		 * Plaintiff Pao On wanted assurance that they would be protected against any fall in the public co’s share price during the period of restriction. 
		 * After much negotiation, Defendant Lau Yiu Long signed a separate agreement to **indemnify the Plaintiff Pao On against any loss as a result of the restriction**. 
		 * Public company share prices *dropped steeply* during the period of restriction. 
		 * Plaintiff Pao On sued the Defendant Lau Yiu Long on  the basis of the indemnity. 
		 * Defendant Lau Yiu Long argued that there was **no valid consideration for their promise to indemnify**, because Plaintiff Pao On's undertaking not to sell was PAST CONSIDERATION.
	* Court Ruling: 
		* Elements for **past consideration to be VALID**
			1. The act must have been done at the promisor’s request
			2. the parties must have understood that the act was to be remunerated either by a payment of the conferment of some other benefit; and 
			3. the payment, or the conferment of a benefit, must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance
		* Court determined all 3 elements were satisfied, by looking at the substance of the Parties' transactions to determine if the alleged act was truly past consideration.
		* Courts do not MERELY LOOK AT FORM *(the chronology of events)*.

## Idea of reciprocity
*Idea of reciprocity*: Promisee who wishes to *enforce a promise* must first have furnished consideration for the promise.
* Benefit or Detriment must be requested by the PROMISOR 
* Though Consideration must be provided by the PROMISEE, *it need not move to the Promisor*, and may instead move to *THIRD PARTIES*

### Exceptions to the Idea of reciprocity
#### Joint promise doctrine
* `Coulls v Bagots Executor & Trustee Co Ltd`
	* Case Summary:
	 * Court Ruling: 
		  * If **contracting parties are JOINT PROMISEES**, then one of them can provide Consideration on behalf of the other PROMISEE.

## Sufficiency of Consideration
*Sufficiency*: Having 'legal' validity
* Generally, Consideration is considered 'sufficient' *(holding legal validity)* when it has **economic value**.
* When there are no price tags attached, determining sufficiency of consideration becomes more challenging.
*Adequacy*: Fairness of comparable value

The Law does not look into ADEQUACY of Consideration, and only looks at the SUFFICIENCY of Consideration.
* Why though?
* `Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd`
