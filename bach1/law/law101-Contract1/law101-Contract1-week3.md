### Ingredients of a contract
* Offer (WK1)
* Acceptance (WK1)
* Certainty && Completeness (WK2)
* Consideration (WK3)

### Evaluating Consideration
1. ==Identify the Promise== being enforced *(who's enforcing the promise against who?)*.
2. ==Identify the Promisor and Promisee== *(who made the promise, who needs to provide consideration?)*
3. Identify the ==consideration== (or lack thereof) made by the Promisee.
4. Evaluate whether the ==consideration was VALID, SUFFICIENT or COMPLETE== for the promise being made.
## Consideration
*Consideration*: Consideration signifies a RETURN *(recognised in law)* given in exchange for the PROMISE SOUGHT TO BE ENFORCED.
* The PROMISE, PERFORMANCE, FORBEARANCE bargained by the **PROMISOR**, provided by the **PROMISEE** in exchange for the PROMISOR's PROMISE.
	* Safeguards the PROMISER, who is providing the promise.
	* Consideration is provided by the PROMISEE.
* Based on the damn basic idea of reciprocity, an essential element of a Contract *(otherwise it's just considered a gift, not a Contract)*
* Without Consideration from the Promisee, there is an ==unequal weightage of stakes, and Contract CANNOT BE ENFORCEABLE==.
* Comes in the form of RIGHT, INTEREST, PROFIT or BENEFIT to the Promisor, or FORBEARANCE, DETRIMENT, LOSS or RESPONSIBILITY suffered by the Promisee.

Fresh consideration required for variations to existing contracts *unless* expressly dispensed with by the contracting parties
* *`Ma Hongjin [36], [60]`

## Contracts by deed
*Contracts by deed*: Contracts that are **SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED** to create an ==EXPRESSED legal obligation==.
* Consideration NOT REQUIRED for enforceability of Contracts by deed, since the legal obligation holds parties accountable in Court of Law.
* Contrasted with **Simple Contracts** *(the other IMPLICIT CONTRACTS)* covered in Week 1 and 2.
* *Signed*: Signatures required
* *Sealed*: Literally sealed with a Seal *(company seal)*
* *Delivered*: Copy of Contract must be passed on to both Promisee, Promisor and Third Parties

### Executory consideration
*Executory*: Consideration is a COUNTER-PROMISE provided for the promise.
* Promises made in a contract will be **delivered IN THE FUTURE**.
	* `Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR(R) 502`
 
### Executed consideration
*Executed*: Consideration is an ACT for the promise.
* Promises made in a contract are **executed IMMEDIATELY**.
* Usually seen in ==unilateral contracts==.

## Benefit-detriment analysis
*Benefit-detriment analysis*: A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance *(refraining from exercising a given right)*, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.
* Consideration is a ==BENEFIT conferred by the promisee on the **PROMISOR**== in return for the *promisor’s promise*
* Consideration is also a ==DETRIMENT incurred/suffered by the **PROMISEE**== in return for the *promisor’s promise*

> `Gay Choon Ing [67]`: *benefit-detriment is preferred as ‘the most workable of all the definitions'*

*Factual benefit*: ==Practical benefit *(actual benefit)*== that can be conferred to a party in a transaction.
*Legal benefit*: ==Benefit *(as per the contract, enforced by the law)*== that should be conferred to a party in a transaction.

## Price of Promise analysis
*Price of Promise analysis*: Promisee ‘buys’ the promisor’s promise by doing some act for it or by offering a counter-promise in return.

## Past consideration
*Past consideration*: Act that is done ==**prior to** and **independent of** a promise==.
* By its very definition, past consideration CANNOT be regarded as a valid consideration.
	* VALID CONSIDERATION for a promise must be ==**causally related** to the promise itself==.
	* Given in exchange for a promise.

### Exceptions to Past consideration being invalid
* An act done BEFORE the giving of a promise to **make a payment** or to **confer some benefit** can SOMETIMES be seen as Consideration for the promise.
#### The `Pao On` exception
* `Pao On v Lau Yiu Long`
	* Case Summary:
			* ==Defendant Lau Yiu Long were the PROMISOR==, ==Plaintiff Pao On were the PROMISEE==. 
			* Plaintiff Pao On expected to provide ==sufficient consideration== for their expectation of Defendant Lau Yiu Long to fulfil their promise.
			* Plaintiff Pao On signed a contract with a public company to ==sell ALL their shares in a private company==.
			* Under the contract, Plaintiff Pao On was to be ==paid with shares issued by the public company==. 
			* Defendant Lau Yiu Long were majority shareholders of the public company, and feared the heavy selling of public company stock by the Plaintiff Pao On would ==depress the public company's share price==.
			* As such, Plaintiff Pao On also undertook ==**not to sell or transfer** 60% of the public company shares received until end April 1974==.
			* Plaintiff Pao On wanted assurance that they would be protected against any fall in the public co’s share price during the period of restriction. 
			* After much negotiation, Defendant Lau Yiu Long signed a separate agreement to ==**indemnify the Plaintiff Pao On against any loss as a result of the restriction==**. 
			* Public company share prices *dropped steeply* during the period of restriction. 
			* Plaintiff Pao On sued the Defendant Lau Yiu Long ==on the basis of the indemnity==. 
			* Defendant Lau Yiu Long argued that there was **no valid consideration for their promise to indemnify**, because Plaintiff Pao On's undertaking not to sell was PAST CONSIDERATION.
	* Court Ruling: 
		* ==Elements for **past consideration to be VALID**==
			1. The act must have been done at the promisor’s *(person who made the SUBSEQUENT PROMISE)* request
			2. The parties must have understood that the **act was to be remunerated** by *a payment of the conferment of some other benefit* 
			3. The payment, or conferment of a benefit, must have been **legally enforceable** had it been promised in advance
		* Court determined all 3 elements were satisfied, by looking at the ==substance of the Parties' transactions== to determine if the alleged act was truly past consideration.
		* Courts do not MERELY LOOK AT FORM *(the chronology of events)*.

## Idea of reciprocity
*Idea of reciprocity*: Promisee who wishes to *enforce a promise* must first have furnished consideration for the promise.
* Benefit or Detriment must be requested by the PROMISOR ==*(expressed or implied)*==
* Though Consideration must be provided by the PROMISEE, *it need not move to the Promisor*, and may ==instead move to *THIRD PARTIES*==.
	* *Third Party*: Someone not involved in the direct transaction, on whom the benefit can be conferred on by the Promisee as Consideration, if so requested by the Promisor.

### Exceptions to the Idea of reciprocity
#### Joint promise doctrine
* `Coulls v Bagots Executor & Trustee Co Ltd`
	* Case Summary:
		* Plaintiff Coulls died on 8 June 1960. In his will, he appointed Defendant Bagot’s Executor and Trustee Co Ltd to be his **executor and trustee**.
		* Plaintiff Coulls entered into a contract with O’Neil Constructions Pty Ltd to quarry a part of his land. In exchange, O’Neil Constructions Pty Ltd would **pay royalties to** Plaintiff Coulls and his wife, Mrs Doris Coulls, as joint tenants.
		* Mrs Doris Coulls had to append her signature to the contract document.
		* When Plaintiff Coulls died, Defendant Bagots sought to determine whether O’Neil Constructions Pty Ltd was required to pay the royalties to the estate or to Mrs Coulls.
		* Court Ruling: 
		  * If **contracting parties are JOINT PROMISEES**, then one of them can provide Consideration on behalf of the other PROMISEE.

## Sufficiency of Consideration
*Sufficiency*: Having 'legal' validity
* Generally, Consideration is considered 'sufficient' *(holding legal validity)* when it has **economic value**.
* When there are no price tags attached, determining sufficiency of consideration becomes more challenging.
*Adequacy*: Fairness of comparable value

The Law ==does not look into ADEQUACY of Consideration==, and only looks at the SUFFICIENCY of Consideration.
* The Courts respect **Party Autonomy** in Contract Law.
	* `Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd`
		* Case Summary:
			* Defendants Nestlé, contracted with a company that made gramophone records **to buy several recordings of music**. 
			* Plaintiffs Chappell & Co owned the copyright in these recordings.
			* Defendant Nestlé offered to sell these records at a *discount price to anyone presenting three wrappers from their chocolate bars*. 
			* Plaintiffs Chappell & Co sought an injunction restraining the **manufacture and sale of the records** because they breached copyright.
		* Legal Issue:
			* Defendant Nestle argued the wrappers were PART OF the Consideration and this was not covered by the Copyright Act 1956, which only applied to monetary sales. 
			* The issue was then **whether the wrappers were Consideration for the SALE OF RECORDS** or whether they were merely a *qualification for buying the records*.
		* Court Ruling:
			* House of Lords held that ==the wrappers DID FORM PART OF the Consideration== for the *sale of records* although they had *NO intrinsic economic value*.
	
### Is Consideration SUFFICIENT?
#### Moral Obligations
* **Moral obligations** that DO NOT have economic value do not constitute sufficient Consideration, particularly because they are difficult to enforce and encourage the wrong kind of behaviour.
	* `White v Bluett`
		 * Case Summary:
			* Plaintiff White promised to release his Defendant son, Bluett from legal obligations to pay a sum of money, if Defendant Bluett would stop complaining about unequal treatment by the Plaintiff White in the distribution of assets among his children.
		* Court Ruling:
			* **Insufficient Consideration**
		   * Since the issue being dealt with here is one of sufficiency (or the lack thereof) of consideration, we see that considerations that **lack economic value**, especially those with ==moral obligation== like promising to stop complaining are HARD TO ENFORCE and ==ENCOURAGE THE WRONG BEHAVIOUR==, especially when they relate to actions to be undertaken in the future.
	 
#### Intangibles (Discretionary Promise)
* *Discretionary promise*: Consideration would again be illusory where it was alleged to consist of **a promise the terms of which left performance entirely to the discretion of the PROMISOR**. A person does not provide consideration by promising to do something ‘if I feel like it’, or ‘unless I change my mind’.
	* `Ma Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd [2021]`
		* Case Summary:
			 * In 2015, Plaintiff Mdm Ma Hongjin *(an investor)* entered into a convertible loan agreement with the Defendant SCP, who owns and controls Biomax Holdings Pte Ltd. 
			 * Under the CLA, Mdm Ma **was to extend a $5m loan to SCP over two years**, while **SCP was to pay interest at 10% per annum**.
			 * After 2 months, Plaintiff Mdm Ma Hongjin and her husband, Mr Han became unhappy with SCP’s financial results.
			 * Mr Han re-negotiated some terms of the CLA with SCP’s controlling shareholder Mr Sim Eng Tong, after which Mdm Ma and SCP entered into a supplemental agreement. 
			 * Under the SA, **SCP had to pay an additional “lump sum facility fee” of S$250,000**, while Defendant Mdm Ma Hongjin did NOT assume any additional obligations to SCP.
			 * SCP failed to pay the facility fee. Defendant Mdm Ma Hongjin then commenced proceedings to obtain payment of the facility fee, as well as other sums which were not the subject of the appeal.
		 * Court Ruling:
			* Court ruled that the Supplemental Agreement was **unenforceable** as it was NOT SUPPORTED BY CONSIDERATION. 

#### Pre-existing Duties
*Pre-existing duties*: **Public** or **Legal** duty

* ==Mere performance of an **existing legal duty**== is NOT sufficient Consideration.
	* `Collins v Godefroy`
		* Case Summary: 
		  * Defendant Godefroy brought an action against an attorney for negligence and caused Plaintiff Collins to be subpoenaed *(forced to attend court proceedings and give evidence)* to attend. 
		  * Defendant Godefroy wanted to ensure Plaintiff Collins attended the court proceedings as this would help his case, so Defendant Godefroy **promised to pay him one guinea per day** he was at court as *compensation* for the loss of his time= though he had been subpoenaed.
		  * Plaintiff Collins attended court for six days but was not called to give evidence. 
		  * At the end of this Plaintiff Collins demanded payment of six guineas as per the agreement. Defendant Godefroy refused to pay Plaintiff Collins.
		  * Plaintiff Collins sued Defendant Godefroy for the owed sum.
		* Court Ruling:
		  * Plaintiff Collins' attending of the hearing was **NOT sufficient Consideration** to enforce Defendant Godefroy's promise to pay him six guineas, since Plaintiff Collins was ==merely fulfilling his existing legal duty== *(to attend court proceedings should he have any relevant evidence to provide)* since he had been subpoenaed.

 * When the ==act of conduct goes BEYOND what is required by the legal duty==, there is **sufficient Consideration**.
	* `Glassbrook Brothers Ltd v Glamorgan County Council`
		* Case Summary:
		  * During a strike at a coal mine, Plaintiff Glassbrook Brothers Ltd asked for additional police protection for the mine and insisted police officers be stationed on the premises. 
		  * Police superintendent provided patrolling officers but **refused** to station more officers at the coal mine unless the Plaintiff Glassbrook Brothers *paid extra to cover the expense*.
		  * Plaintiff Glassbrook Brothers **agreed to this** but later refused to pay. 
		  * The trial judge and the Court of Appeal both held that the police were entitled to do this. 
		  * Plaintiff Grassbrook Brothers appealed to the House of Lords, and sued Defendant Glamorgan County Council.
		* Court Ruling:
			* House of Lords ruled the police were **entitled to be paid**. While the police had a responsibility to provide protection for life and property, keeping the peace and preventing crime.
			* However, Plaintiff Glassbrook Brothers demanded officers be stationed at the coal mine, which fell outside the police's *public duty*. 
			* As such, there was **SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION provided by the Police**, and the contract was enforceable against Plaintiff Glassbrook Brothers.

* ==Contractual duty owed to a **THIRD PARTY**==
	* `Pao On v Lau Yiu Long`
		* Case Summary covered above
		* Legal Issue:
		   * Would Plaintiff Pao On's performance of an existing contractual duty owed to a 3rd party be sufficient consideration in return for the Defendant Lau Yiu Long's promise to indemnify?
		* Court Ruling:
			* **SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION**
		   * PROMISOR obtained a direct right to enforce the PROMISEE's performance of or promise to perform an *existing contractual duty* owed to a third party.

> FUA: Tie its relation of factual and legal benefit to the court ruling of Stilk v Myrick under ==legal issue== section.

* ==Contractual duty owed to the **SAME PARTY**==
	1. `Stilk v Myrick`
		* Case Summary:
			* On a ship, 2 crewmen deserted and the Defendant Captain Myrick **promised to divide wages of deserters among remaining crew** if they would work the ship safe back to London. Plaintiff Stilk was a crew member, who sued Defendant Captain Myrick to enforce his promise.
		* Legal Issue:
			* Did Plaintiff crew member Stilk provide ==sufficient consideration== in return for Defendant Captain Myrick's promise?
			* *Factual benefit*: ==Practical benefit *(actual benefit)*== that can be conferred to a party in a transaction.
			* *Legal benefit*: ==Benefit *(as per the contract, enforced by the law)*== that should be conferred to a party in a transaction.
		* Court Ruling: 
			* Court concluded ==“factual benefits” that Plaintiff crew member Stilk gave (Plaintiff Stilk and other crew members work the ship safe back to London) amounted to **INSUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION**==  for the enforcement of Defendant Captain Myrick's promise to pay them extra.
			* ==Performance of an EXISTING DUTY== is NOT considered sufficient consideration.
  2. `Williams v Roffey`
		* Case Summary:
			* Defendants Roffey were *main contractors* to refurbish 27 flats for clients by a deadline. 
			* Main contract had a **penalty clause**, where the Defendant Roffey had to pay a penalty to clients if they did not meet the deadline.
		   * Plaintiff Williams were a SUB-CONTRACTOR hired by Defendant Roffey to do carpentry work for the 27 flats for 20,000 pounds.
			* Defendant Roffey became worried that Plaintiff Williams could not finish the work in time. Plaintiff Williams also ran into financial difficulties as the initially agreed 20,000 pounds was NOT ENOUGH for Plaintiff Williams to operate satisfactorily and earn a profit AND Plaintiff Williams failed to supervise their manpower properly.
		   * Defendant Roffey's surveyor persuaded Defendant Roffey to pay the Plaintiff Williams more so Defendant Roffey agreed to pay Plaintiff Williams 10,300 pounds more *(575 pounds per completed flat)*. 
			* Plaintiff Williams completed 8 more flats, but only received 1,500 pounds further payment. Plaintiff Williams ceased work and sued Defendant Roffey.
		* Legal Issue:
			* Did Plaintiff Williams provide **sufficient consideration** in return for Defendant Roffey's promise to pay more?
		* Court Ruling:
			1. If A has **entered into a contract** with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to B in return for payment by B and
			2. At some stage **before** A has completely performed his obligations under the contract, B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain
			3. B thereupon promises A an **additional payment** in return for A’s promise to perform his contractual obligations on time
			4. As a result of giving his promise, B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates *(removes)* a disbenefit
			5. B’s promise is **not given as a result of economic duress or fraud** on the part of A
			6. The benefit to B is **capable** of being Consideration for B’s promise, so that the promise will be legally binding.
		   * *Factual benefit*: PRACTICAL benefit
				* Makes it easy to find **SUFFICIENT Consideration** to support contract modifications.
				* 2 conflicting legal concerns regarding Contract Modification
					1. Parties **should be encouraged to NEGOTIATE a solution** when they encounter problems in performing a contract.
					2. One party **should NOT extract an advantage** by exploiting the weaker bargaining position of the other party.
			* From this perspective, ==the Court ruling on `Williams v Roffey` retroactively contradicts understanding of `Stilk v Myrick`==.
				1. Requirement of fresh consideration required in **variations to existing contracts** unless expressly dispensed with the contracting parties.
				2. Since ==Plaintiff Stilk **did not demand additional payment**, and Defendant Captain Myrick offered the crew extra money== in recognition that they would be required to work harder to achieve the same result. 
				3. This could be construed as Defendant Captain Myrick seeing the Plaintiff crew member Stilk *(Promisee's consideration of guiding the ship back safe as opposed to being dock overseas)* was of ==GREATER OR EQUIVALENT BENEFIT to enforce his promise.==
* ==Performance of **existing contractual duty** must yield FACTUAL BENEFIT to the Promisor== and must have been ==requested “in return” for the promise== to PAY MORE.
	* `Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent`
		* Case Summary:
			* Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc gave Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee Vincent *(a redundant employee)* one month’s notice of termination **under his employment contract** and agreed to pay him enhanced severance pay. 
			* Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee Vincent served out his one month notice period. ==The employer refused to pay the enhanced severance pay.==
			* Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc argued that ==the agreement to do so was unsupported by Consideration==.
			* Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee Vincent argued that the work he did during his notice period was the Consideration.
		* Court Ruling:
		   * ==Court rejected Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee's argument==, holding that work which a redundant employee does during his notice period is *by definition*, of MINIMAL value to his employer. 
			* Plaintiff argued `Williams v Roffey`, Defendant argued `Stilk v Myrick`.
		   * Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc ==did NOT give the employee one month’s notice and secure his labour *in exchange* for the enhanced severance pay==, in other words there was **NO FACTUAL BENEFIT** provided by the Plaintiff employee. 
		   * Instead, Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc gave the Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee **one month’s notice** because ==it was contractually obliged to do so== in order to bring an end to the employment.
* ==Payment of a LESSER SUM cannot be **complete satisfaction** of a debt== unless Consideration is provided in return for the ==promise to ACCEPT LESS==.
	* `Foakes v Beer`
		* Case Summary: 
			* Defendant Beer loaned Plaintiff Foakes an amount. When Plaintiff Foakes was unable to repay this loan, Defendant Beer received a judgment in her favour to recover this amount. 
			* The pair entered an agreement where ‘in consideration’ of an initial payment of £500 and ‘on condition’ of six-monthly payments of £250 until the whole amount was repaid, Defendant Beer **would not enforce her judgment** against Plaintiff Foakes. 
			* Plaintiff Foakes made these regular payments until the entire amount was repaid. 
			* However, Plaintiff Foakes had not paid any interest on the judgement debt, which Defendant Beer was entitled to under statute.
		* Court Ruling: 
			* Defendant Beer's case was that the **promise not to enforce the judgement** was NOT SUPPORTED by good Consideration because Plaintiff Foakes had only done what he was ALREADY contractually bound to do.
			* Applied rule in [Pinnel’s case](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/pinnels-case.php) that **payment of a lesser sum cannot be a complete satisfaction of a debt** UNLESS Consideration is given in return for the promise to accept less.
			* There is sufficient Consideration WHEN the Promisee **provides something different** (that the Promisor accepts) or the Promisee makes partial payment at an earlier date or different place (requested by the Promisor).

### Exceptions to Requirement of Consideration
#### Promissory Estoppel
*Promissory Estoppel*: A party may **recover on the basis of a promise made** when the party's RELIANCE on that promise was REASONABLE, and the party attempting to recover DETRIMENTALLY RELIED on the promise.

##### Elements of Promissory Estoppel
1. Clear and Unequivocal *(unambiguous)* promise ==not to insist on original contractual rights==.
	* ASCERTAINED OBJECTIVELY via the Objectivity test
	* Would **words**, **conduct** of PROMISOR lead a reasonable PROMISEE to believe that the Promisor will not insist on his strict contractual rights?
2. ==Reliance==
	* Evidenced by Promisee's change of position ==by **doing** OR **omitting to do** what he would otherwise not have done or omitted to do== due to the Promise.
	* Seen when Promisee *changes his position*, either doing or not doing what he initially intended to do or not do as a result of the Promise.
		* `The Post Chaser [1982]`
			* Case Summary:
				* Plaintiff Sellers agreed to sell palm-oil to Defendant buyers who had contracted to sell this onto sub-buyers. 
				* Contract required the Plaintiff sellers to **send a declaration of shipment** to the Defendant buyers in writing when the ship set sail. 
				* Plaintiff Sellers gave the declaration *a month after the ship had set sail* and the Defendant buyers DID NOT protest the time delay. 
				* Plaintiff Sellers also handed the documents directly to the sub-buyer at the request of the first buyer. 
				* Sub-buyers rejected the documents. 
				* Defendant Buyers followed the decision of the sub-buyers and the Plaintiff sellers old the oil for less money elsewhere. 
				* Plaintiff sellers sued the Defendant buyers for the difference in the money lost to damages.
			* Legal Issue:
				* Did the Defendant Buyer waive their right to claim **against the delay in the Plaintiff Seller's sending the declaration of shipment** or would it be inequitable *(unfair)* to the Plaintiff Seller to allow them to do so?
			* Court Ruling:
				* Plaintiff Seller’s claim for damages was REJECTED.
				* Court found **declaration of shipment was essential**, particularly with regard to the timings requested by the Defendant Buyer. 
				* Plaintiff Seller had WAIVED their right to *claim against error/delay* by submitting the documents directly to the sub-buyers. 
				* Defendant Buyers were NOT inequitable in rejecting the documents.
		* [`Lam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank AG [2011]`](https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2012_SGHC_182)
3. ==Inequitable== to go back on promise	 
	* Courts must take full account of all relevant circumstances

##### Effects of Promissory Estoppel
* **Suspends** the *original contractual right* OR **extinguishes** it
	* Suspensory with the Promisor being able to RESUME his strict legal rights on reasonable notice being given to the Promisee
		* [`Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947]`](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/london-property-trust-v-high-trees.php)
	* Rights to pure money debt extinguished
		* `Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947]` with respect to past part payments.
	* Extinguished if parties cannot be restored to position before Promisee's reliance 
		* [`Birmingham & District Land Co v London & North Western Railway Co`](https://swarb.co.uk/birmingham-and-district-land-co-v-london-and-north-western-railway-ca-1886/)
