## Consideration
*Consideration*: Consideration signifies a RETURN *(recognised in law)* given in exchange for the PROMISE SOUGHT TO BE ENFORCED.
* The PROMISE, PERFORMANCE, FORBEARANCE bargained by the **PROMISOR**, provided by the **PROMISEE** in exchange for the PROMISOR's PROMISE.
	* Safeguards the PROMISER, who is providing the promise.
	* Consideration is provided by the PROMISEE.
* Based on the damn basic idea of reciprocity, an essential element of a Contract *(otherwise it's just considered a gift, not a Contract)*
* Without Consideration from the Promisee, there is an unequal weightage of stakes, and Contract CANNOT BE ENFORCEABLE.
* Comes in the form of RIGHT, INTEREST, PROFIT or BENEFIT to the Promisor, or FORBEARANCE, DETRIMENT, LOSS or RESPONSIBILITY suffered by the Promisee.

Fresh consideration required for variations to existing contracts *unless* expressly dispensed with by the contracting parties
* *`Ma Hongjin [36], [60]`

## Contracts by deed
*Contracts by deed*: Contracts that are **SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED** to create an EXPRESSED legal obligation.
* Consideration NOT REQUIRED for enforceability of Contracts by deed, since the legal obligation holds parties accountable in Court of Law.
* Contrasted with **Simple Contracts** *(the other IMPLICIT CONTRACTS)* covered in Week 1 and 2.

### Executory consideration
*Executory*: Consideration is a COUNTER-PROMISE

### Executed consideration
*Executed*: Consideration is an ACT

> FUA: Add more details on Executory and Executed consideration

## Benefit-detriment analysis
*Benefit-detriment analysis*: A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.
* Consideration is a BENEFIT conferred by the promisee on the **PROMISOR** in return for the *promisor’s promise*
* Consideration is also a DETRIMENT incurred/suffered by the **PROMISEE** in return for the *promisor’s promise*

> `Gay Choon Ing [67]`: *benefit-detriment is preferred as ‘the most workable of all the definitions*
## Price of Promise analysis
*Price of Promise analysis*: Promisee ‘buys’ the promisor’s promise by doing some act for it or by offering a counter-promise in return.

## Past consideration
*Past consideration*: Act that is done **prior to** and **independent of** a promise.
* By its very definition, past consideration CANNOT be regarded as a valid consideration.
	* VALID CONSIDERATION for a promise must be **causally related** to the promise itself.
	* Given in exchange for a promise.

### Exceptions to Past consideration being invalid
* An act done BEFORE the giving of a promise to **make a payment** or to **confer some benefit** can SOMETIMES be seen as Consideration for the promise.
#### The `Pao On` exception
* `Pao On v Lau Yiu Long`
	* Case Summary:
		 * Plaintiff Pao On signed a contract with a public company to sell ALL their shares in a private company.
		 * Under the contract, Plaintiff Pao On was to be paid with shares issued by the public company. 
		 * Defendant Lau Yiu Long were majority shareholders of the public company, and feared the heavy selling of public company stock by the Plaintiff Pao On would depress the public company's share price.
		* As such, Plaintiff Pao On also undertook **not to sell or transfer** 60% of the public company shares received until end April 1974.
		 * Plaintiff Pao On wanted assurance that they would be protected against any fall in the public co’s share price during the period of restriction. 
		 * After much negotiation, Defendant Lau Yiu Long signed a separate agreement to **indemnify the Plaintiff Pao On against any loss as a result of the restriction**. 
		 * Public company share prices *dropped steeply* during the period of restriction. 
		 * Plaintiff Pao On sued the Defendant Lau Yiu Long on  the basis of the indemnity. 
		 * Defendant Lau Yiu Long argued that there was **no valid consideration for their promise to indemnify**, because Plaintiff Pao On's undertaking not to sell was PAST CONSIDERATION.
	* Court Ruling: 
		* Elements for **past consideration to be VALID**
			1. The act must have been done at the promisor’s request
			2. the parties must have understood that the act was to be remunerated either by a payment of the conferment of some other benefit; and 
			3. the payment, or the conferment of a benefit, must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance
		* Court determined all 3 elements were satisfied, by looking at the substance of the Parties' transactions to determine if the alleged act was truly past consideration.
		* Courts do not MERELY LOOK AT FORM *(the chronology of events)*.

## Idea of reciprocity
*Idea of reciprocity*: Promisee who wishes to *enforce a promise* must first have furnished consideration for the promise.
* Benefit or Detriment must be requested by the PROMISOR 
* Though Consideration must be provided by the PROMISEE, *it need not move to the Promisor*, and may instead move to *THIRD PARTIES*

### Exceptions to the Idea of reciprocity
#### Joint promise doctrine
* `Coulls v Bagots Executor & Trustee Co Ltd`
	* Case Summary:
	 * Court Ruling: 
		  * If **contracting parties are JOINT PROMISEES**, then one of them can provide Consideration on behalf of the other PROMISEE.

## Sufficiency of Consideration
*Sufficiency*: Having 'legal' validity
* Generally, Consideration is considered 'sufficient' *(holding legal validity)* when it has **economic value**.
* When there are no price tags attached, determining sufficiency of consideration becomes more challenging.
*Adequacy*: Fairness of comparable value

The Law does not look into ADEQUACY of Consideration, and only looks at the SUFFICIENCY of Consideration.
* Why though?
* `Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd`
> FUA: Add Case summary and court ruling here and see how this case fits into this point.

### Is Consideration SUFFICIENT?
#### Moral Obligations
* **Moral obligations** that DO NOT have economic value do not constitute sufficient Consideration, particularly because they are difficult to enforce.
	* `White v Bluett`
		 * Case Summary:
			* Plaintiff White promised to release his Defendant son, Bluett from legal obligations to pay a sum of money, if Defendant Bluett would stop complaining about unequal treatment by the Plaintiff White in the distribution of assets among his children.
		* Court Ruling:
			* **Insufficient Consideration**
		   * Since the issue being dealt with here is one of sufficiency (or the lack thereof) of consideration, we see that considerations that **lack economic value** like promising to stop complaining are HARD TO ENFORCE, especially when they relate to actions to be undertaken in the future.
	 
#### Intangibles (Discretionary Promise)
* *Discretionary promise*: Consideration would again be illusory where it was alleged to consist of **a promise the terms of which left performance entirely to the discretion of the PROMISOR**. A person does not provide consideration by promising to do something ‘if I feel like it’, or ‘unless I change my mind’.
	* `Ma Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd [2021]`
		* Case Summary:
			 * In 2015, Plaintiff Mdm Ma Hongjin *(an investor)* entered into a convertible loan agreement with the Defendant SCP, who owns and controls Biomax Holdings Pte Ltd. 
			 * Under the CLA, Mdm Ma **was to extend a $5m loan to SCP over two years**, while **SCP was to pay interest at 10% per annum**.
			 * After 2 months, Plaintiff Mdm Ma Hongjin and her husband, Mr Han became unhappy with SCP’s financial results.
			 * Mr Han re-negotiated some terms of the CLA with SCP’s controlling shareholder Mr Sim Eng Tong, after which Mdm Ma and SCP entered into a supplemental agreement. 
			 * Under the SA, **SCP had to pay an additional “lump sum facility fee” of S$250,000**, while Defendant Mdm Ma Hongjin did NOT assume any additional obligations to SCP.
			 * SCP failed to pay the facility fee. Defendant Mdm Ma Hongjin then commenced proceedings to obtain payment of the facility fee, as well as other sums which were not the subject of the appeal.
		 * Court Ruling:
			* Court ruled that the Supplemental Agreement was **unenforceable** as it was NOT SUPPORTED BY CONSIDERATION. 

#### Pre-existing Duties
*Pre-existing duties*: **Public** or **Legal** duty

* Mere performance of an **existing legal duty** is NOT sufficient Consideration.
	* `Colins v Godefroy`
		* Case Summary: 
		* Court Ruling:
		  * NOT SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION
> FUA: Add Case Summary and Court Ruling for this

 * When the act of conduct goes BEYOND what is required by the legal duty, there is **sufficient Consideration**.
	* `Glassbrook Brothers Ltd v Glamorgan County Council`
		* Case Summary:
		* Court Ruling:
		  * There was SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION.
> FUA: Add Case Summary and Court Ruling for this

* Contractual duty owed to a **THIRD PARTY**
	* `Pao On v Lau Yiu Long`
		* Case Summary covered above
		* Legal Issue:
		   * Would Plaintiff Pao On's performance of an existing contractual duty owed to a 3rd party be sufficient consideration in return for the Defendant Lau Yiu Long's promise to indemnify?
		* Court Ruling:
			* **SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION**
		   * PROMISOR obtained a direct right to enforce the PROMISEE's performance of or promise to perform an *existing contractual duty* owed to a third party.

* Contractual duty owed to the **SAME PARTY**
	1. `Stilk v Myrick`
		* Case Summary:
			* On a ship, 2 crewmen deserted and the Defendant Captain Myrick promised to divide wages of deserters among remaining crew if they would work the ship safe back to London. Plaintiff Stilk was a crew member, who sued Defendant Captain Myrick to enforce his promise.
		* Legal Issue:
			* Did Plaintiff Stilk provide sufficient consideration in return for Defendant Captain Myrick's promise?
		* Court Ruling: 
			* Court concluded “practical benefits” that Defendant Captain Myrick's promise gave (Plaintiff Stilk and other crew members work the ship safe back to London) amounted to **sufficient consideration**.
			* Requirement of fresh consideration required in **variations to existing contracts** unless expressly dispensed with the contracting parties.
			* Since Plaintiff Stilk **did not demand additional payment**, and Defendant Captain Myrick offered the crew in recognition that they would be required to work harder to achieve the same result. This could also be construed as a GREATER BENEFIT to the captain that the ship was returned to London as opposed to being docked overseas. 
  2. `Williams v Roffey`
		* Case Summary:
			* Defendants Roffey were *main contractors* to refurbish 27 flats for clients by a deadline. 
			* Main contract had a **penalty clause**, where the Defendant Roffey had to pay a penalty to clients if they did not meet the deadline.
		   * Plaintiff Williams were a SUB-CONTRACTOR hired by Defendant Roffey to do carpentry work for the 27 flats for 20,000 pounds.
			* Defendant Roffey became worried that Plaintiff Williams could not finish the work in time. Plaintiff Williams also ran into financial difficulties as the initally agreed 20,000 pounds was NOT ENOUGH for Plaintiff Williams to operate satisfactorily and earn a profit AND Plaintiff Williams failed to supervise their manpower properly.
		   * Defendant Roffey's surveyor persuaded Defendant Roffey to pay the Plaintiff Williams more so Defendant Roffey agreed to pay Plaintiff Williams 10,300 pounds more *(575 pounds per completed flat)*. 
			* Plaintiff Williams completed 8 more flats, but only received 1,500 pounds further payment. Plaintiff Williams ceased work and sued Defendant Roffey.
		* Legal Issue:
			* Did Plaintiff Williams provide **sufficient consideration** in return for Defendant Roffey's promise to pay more?
		* Court Ruling:
			1. If A has **entered into a contract** with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to B in return for payment by B and
			2. At some stage **before** A has completely performed his obligations under the contract, B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain
			3. B thereupon promises A an **additional payment** in return for A’s promise to perform his contractual obligations on time
			4. As a result of giving his promise, B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates *(removes)* a disbenefit
			5. B’s promise is **not given as a result of economic duress or fraud** on the part of A
			6. The benefit to B is **capable** of being Consideration for B’s promise, so that the promise will be legally binding.
		   * *Practical benefit*: FACTUAL benefit
				* Makes it easy to find **SUFFICIENT Consideration** to support contract modifications.
				* 2 conflicting legal concerns regarding Contract Modification
					1. Parties **should be encouraged to NEGOTIATE a solution** when they encounter problems in performing a contract.
					2. One party **should NOT extract an advantage** by exploiting the weaker bargaining position of the other party.
* Performance of **existing contractual duty** must yield FACTUAL or PRACTICAL BENEFIT to the Promisor and must have been requested “in return” for the promise to PAY MORE.
	* `Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent`
		* Case Summary:
			* Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc gave Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee Vincent *(a redundant employee)* one month’s notice of termination **under his employment contract** and agreed to pay him enhanced severance pay. 
			* Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee Vincent served out his one month notice period. The employer refused to pay the enhanced severance pay. 
			* Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc argued that the agreement to do so was unsupported by Consideration.
			* Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee Vincent argued that the work he did during his notice period was the Consideration.
		* Court Ruling:
		   * Court rejected Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee's argument, holding that **work which a redundant employee does during his notice period is by definition, of MINIMAL value to his employer**. 
		   * Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc did NOT give the employee one month’s notice and secure his labour *in exchange* for the enhanced severance pay. 
		   * Instead, Defendant employer Sea-Land Service Inc gave the Plaintiff employee Cheong Fook Chee **one month’s notice** because it was contractually obliged to do so in order to bring an end to the employment.
