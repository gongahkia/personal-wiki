## 2. Express terms
### Issue of INCORPORATION
Even if parties intended for the statement to be an express term, ==did it become **part of their contract**==?
* Often raised in *incorporation of exception clauses* or *onerous terms in a contract*.
* Generally, ==INCORPORATION must occur *at time* Contract was made==, and NOT *after*.  
* Courts take the **OBJECTIVE APPROACH**.
### 3 types of Incorporation
1. Incorporation by SIGNATURE
2. Incorporation by NOTICE
3. Incorporation by PREVIOUS COURSE OF DEALING

#### 1. Incorporation by SIGNATURE
##### General Rule
* ==**GENERAL RULE**==: where a person ==*signs a written document*==, ==knowing it to be a contract that governs the relations between him and the other party==, *all terms, including exception clauses*, contained in that document are INCORPORATED into the contract.
	* `L’Estrange v Graucob Ltd (1971)`
		* *“When a document containing contractual terms is signed, then, in the absence of fraud, or ... misrepresentation, the party signing it is bound, and it is wholly immaterial whether he has read the document or not.”*
* GENERAL RULE is affirmed in Singapore's Court of Appeal.
	* `Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C & T Corp [2019]`
##### Exceptions to General Rule
* **General rule** DOES NOT apply where there is ==fraud or misrepresentation== as to the effect of the *term concerned*.
	* `Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co [1951]`
		* Case Summary:
			* Plaintiff Curtis took wedding dress to Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co for cleaning and asked Plaintiff Curtis to sign a receipt with a clause **exempting Defendant from liability** 'if any damage caused'.

		   * Plaintiff Curtis signed the receipt.
			* Dress was returned damaged to Plaintiff Curtis.
			* Plaintiff Curtis sued Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co, who tried to rely on their exception clause to avoid liability.
		* Court Ruling:
			* ==MISREPRESENTATION== of the exception clause

			* Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co could *only rely on the exception clause* for damage to sequins and beads.
