In past weeks 1-3, we covered the *elements for CONTRACT FORMATION.*
### Elements of formation of a contract
1. Offer and Acceptance
2. Certainty, Completeness, Intention to create legal relations
3. Consideration

Now, we'll be covering the *terms of a contract*, in other words the *conditions and scope* of a given contract.
### Terms of the contract
1. ==EXPRESS Terms==
	* EXPLICIT expectations listed in the written contract.
	* **To do**
		* Proving terms
		* Ascertain meaning
2. ==IMPLIED Terms==
	* IMPLIED expectations not necessarily written out, but nonetheless understood and expected.
	* **To do**
		* Tests for implying

## Definitions
* Liability: state of being legally responsible for something
* Mere representation:  
	* Statement of past or present fact that ==**encourages *(induces)* a party to make a contract**==, but is NOT part of the contract *(not intended to have contractual effect)*.
	* Could give rise to legal consequence if qualified as *Misrepresentation*.

* Express Term:  
	* **Promised undertaking** laid out in the contract.
	* Promise for which the ==promisor assumes contractual liability==.

## 2. Express terms
### Issue of INCORPORATION
Even if parties intended for the statement to be an express term, ==did it become **part of their contract**==?
* Often raised in *incorporation of exception clauses* or *onerous terms in a contract*.
* Generally, ==INCORPORATION must occur *at time* Contract was made==, and NOT *after*.  
* Courts take the **OBJECTIVE APPROACH**.
### 3 types of Incorporation
1. Incorporation by **SIGNATURE**
2. Incorporation by **NOTICE**
3. Incorporation by **PREVIOUS COURSE OF DEALING**

#### 1. Incorporation by SIGNATURE
##### General Rule
* ==**GENERAL RULE**==: where a person ==*signs a written document*==, ==knowing it to be a contract that governs the relations between him and the other party==, *all terms, including exception clauses*, contained in that document are INCORPORATED into the contract.
	* `L’Estrange v Graucob Ltd (1971)`
		* *“When a document containing contractual terms is signed, then, in the absence of fraud, or ... misrepresentation, the party signing it is bound, and it is wholly immaterial whether he has read the document or not.”*
* GENERAL RULE AFFIRMED in Singapore's Court of Appeal.
	* `Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C & T Corp [2019]`
##### Exceptions to General Rule
* **General rule** DOES NOT apply where there is ==fraud or misrepresentation== as to the effect of the *term concerned*.
	* `Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co [1951]`
		* Case Summary:
			* Plaintiff Curtis took wedding dress to Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co for cleaning and asked Plaintiff Curtis to sign a receipt with a clause **exempting Defendant from liability** 'if any damage caused'.
		   * Defendant Employee claimed Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co did not accept liability for damage to beads and sequins *(implying Defendant Co would accept damage to other aspects of the dress)*.
		   * Plaintiff Curtis signed the receipt.
			* Dress was returned damaged to Plaintiff Curtis.
			* Plaintiff Curtis sued Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co, who tried to rely on their exception clause to avoid liability.
		* Court Ruling:
			* ==MISREPRESENTATION== of the exception clause
			* Defendant Employee **MISREPRESENTED** the extent of ==exception clause== and induced P to sign the receipt.
			* Defendant Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co could *only rely on the exception clause* for damage to sequins and beads.
#### 2. Incorporation by NOTICE
*Incorporation by Notice*: ==Inclusion of terms and conditions in a contract== by referring to them in ==another document or another contract==. 
##### No Notice at all, Actual Notice,  Reasonable Notice required
* `Parker v South Eastern Railway Co (1877)`
	* Case Summary:
		* Plaintiff Parker left bag at station cloakroom and got a ticket, which stated 'SEE BACK' on the ticket, pointing to clauses limiting Defendant South Eastern Railway Co's **liability** to 10 pounds for loss of items with them.
		* Plaintiff Parker's bag was lost.
	* Legal Issue:
		* Did Plaintiff Parker ==SEE or KNOW that there were conditions== printed on the ticket?
	* Court Ruling:
		* ***NO NOTICE AT ALL***
			* Plaintiff Parker **DID NOT KNOW** there were conditions written on the ticket --> Plaintiff is ==not bound by conditions==
		* ***ACTUAL NOTICE***
			* Plaintiff parker **KNEW** there was writing, and **KNEW or BELIEVED** the writing contained conditions --> Plaintiff is ==bound by conditions==
		* ***REASONABLE NOTICE REQUIRED***
			* Plaintiff parker **KNEW** there was writing, but ==**DID NOT KNOW or BELIEVE**== the writing contained conditions --> Plaintiff is nevertheless ==bound by conditions==
				* *If delivering of ticket to Plaintiff Parker was in such manner that ==he could see there was writing upon it==, that constituted **reasonable notice** that the writing contained conditions.

> FUA: Add Case Summary, Legal Issue and Court Ruling for the cases below.
##### Evaluating Reasonable Notice: Red hand rule
*Red hand rule*: Courts hold that a ==literal red hand== points to an unfair contract term in a written contract.
* `Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd [1971]`: The **more ONEROUS or UNUSUAL** an Exception clause, the ==**GREATER the requirements for reasonable notice==.
	1. `Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stilletto Visual Programmes Ltd [1989]`
		* Case Summary:
			* 
		* Legal Issue:
			* 
		* Court Ruling:
			* 
* Red hand rule **APPLIED** in Singapore.
	2. `Hakko Products Pte Ltd v Danzas (S) Pte Ltd [1999]`
		* Case Summary:
			* 
		* Legal Issue:
			* 
		* Court Ruling:
			* 
##### Exceptions to Red hand rule
* Red hand rule **DOES NOT APPLY** to Signed contracts.
	* `Press Automation at [39]`: *'the line of authorities that decides that onerous and unusual conditions cannot be incorporated unless the attention of the party sought to be bound has been specifically drawn to them DOES NOT APPLY to a case like this where ==there is a signed contract with an explicit incorporating clause==.'*
 
#### 3. Incorporation by PREVIOUS COURSE OF DEALING
##### Basic test
* **Basic test**: Whether at time of Contract formation, ==each party *(as a reasonable person)* could **infer** from past dealings and conduct of the other== that the express term was incorporated into the Contract.
	* `Vinmar at [53] citing Furmston` 
		* *"Whether, at the time of contracting, each party as a reasonable person was entitled to infer from the past dealings and the actions and the words of the other ..., that the term was to be a part of the contract."*
##### Elements of Basic test: Previous course of dealing
* **NUMBER** of previous contracts
* **RECENCY** of previous contract *(how recent something was)* 
* **CONSISTENCY** of previous contracts 
* **SUBJECT MATTER** of previous contract *(whether similar subject matter)*

> `Vinmar at [58]`
> - In general, it is ==much easier to *establish INCORPORATION by previous course of dealing* when both parties are in **business**== rather than when one was a consumer.
> - *INCORPORATION by previous course of dealing* is also easier when ==the term is **not unusual or unreasonable**==.

###### Number of and Recency of previous contracts
1. `Vinmar at [60]`
	* Case Summary:
		* 4 contracts made between December 2013 and October 2014 before the *contract in dispute* in November 2014.
	* Court Ruling:
		* Court held that there was **sufficient incorporation of express terms** in the Contract by ==previous course of dealings== due to the NUMBER of previous contracts made and the RECENCY of said contracts.
> FUA: Add case summary for this section below and tweak court ruling to infuse reasoning for the judgement in relation to the point.
2. `Hollier v Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd [1971]`
	* Case Summary:
		* 3 or 4 car repair transactions over 5 years.
	* Court Ruling:
		* Court held that there was **NOT a sufficient incorporation of express terms** in the contract by ==previous course of dealings== due to the small NUMBER of previous contracts made and how OLD those contracts were.
###### Consistency of previous contracts (similarity of subject matter, how contract made)
1. `Vinmar at [60]`
	* Case Summary:
		* All 4 contracts made were for *purchase of commodities*, and *all concluded in the same manner*, with oral negotiations followed by correspondence laying out key terms. PTT then sent Vinmar a supply agreement stating the full terms.
		* Neither party signed.
	* Court Ruling:
		* Court held that there was **sufficient incorporation of express terms** in the contract by ==previous course of dealings== due to the CONSISTENCY in the SUBJECT MATTER and HOW THE CONTRACT WAS MADE between all of them.
2. `MGA International Pte Ltd v Wajilam Exports (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2010]`
	* Case Summary:
		* 17 dealings in 13 months BUT the express terms *sought to be incorporated* were discussed **in the first dealing only**, without continuous notice of those terms being reaffirmed in subsequent dealings.
	* Court Ruling:
		* Court held that there was **NOT a sufficient incorporation of express terms** in the contract by ==previous course of dealings== due to the LACK OF CONSISTENCY in the SUBJECT MANNER and that the agreement on HOW THE CONTRACT WAS MADE was only discussed once at the very beginning.

### Proving vs Interpreting express terms
#### Proving
* Necessary when parties disagree over **WHAT EXPRESS TERMS** govern their Contract.
* PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE *may apply* and ==limits what evidence can be produced in Court to prove express terms==.
* ENTIRE AGREEMENT CLAUSE (EAC) *applies* in ==written contracts==, pertaining to effect of the clause.
#### Interpreting 
* Necessary when parties disagree over **WHAT EXPRESS TERMS MEAN**.
* CONTEXTUAL INTERPRETATION: ==ascertain objectively== parties' intention at time of Contract formation, to determine *meaning of express terms*.
* What ==contextual facts== can be used for interpretation of express terms?
	* Facts allowed under **exception** to PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE
	* Limits of Contract law *(eg. objective ascertainment)*
* ==Canons of Interpretation== in the CONTRA PROFERENTEM rule

### Proving express terms
#### Parole Evidence Rule
* ==EXCLUDES any evidence beyond the contractual document itself== *if* the written contract was intended by the parties to represent the **entire agreement between them**.
	1. *When the terms of a contract have been ==reduced by the parties to the **form of a document**==, NO evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract ==EXCEPT the document itself==.*
		* `Section 93 of Evidence Act`
	2. *When the terms of a contract have been ==proved according to section 93==, NO evidence of any **oral agreement or statement** shall be admitted for the purpose of ==contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from== the terms of the contract.*
		* `Section 94 of Evidence Act`
* To determine intentions of the parties *(so as to apply the Parole Evidence Rule)*, we can look at ==**Extrinsic evidence**==, ==**Document attributes**== and ==presence of **Entire Agreement Clause (EAC)**==.
##### Extrinsic evidence 
* Facts outside the document *(extrinsic evidence)* CAN be considered when deducing parties' intentions.
	* *"in determining whether the parties so intended, ==the court may look at extrinsic evidence and apply the **normal OBJECTIVE TEST**==, subject to a rebuttable presumption that a contract which is complete on its face was intended to contain all the terms of the parties’ agreement."*
		* `Zurich Ins at [40]`
##### Document attributes
* Document's attributes are RELEVANT in determining deducing parties' intentions, and thus whether the *Parole Evidence Rule* can be applied.
	* *"==Different genres of documents may require different treatment==. For example, for **standard form contracts** and **documents intended for commercial circulation**, the ==presumption that **all the terms** of the agreement between the parties are contained in the contract== will be almost impossible to rebut."*
		* `Zurich Ins at [110]`
##### Entire Agreement Clause (EAC)
* *Presence of Entire Agreement Clause* in a document ==**defines the parties' rights and obligations** WITHIN the written contractual document==.
	* *eg.* `11.1 This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties in connection with the matters dealt with and described herein.`
	* *"Generally, such clauses are conducive to certainty as they ==define and confine the parties’ rights and obligations within the four corners of the written document== thereby precluding any attempt to qualify or supplement the document by reference to pre-contractual representations"*
		 * `Lee Chee Wei at [25]`
	* *"an ==appropriately worded provision== would be acknowledged and upheld if it clearly purports to ==deprive any pre-contractual or collateral agreement of legal effect==, whether from the perspective of **evidential admissibility** or **contractual invalidation**"*
		 * `Lee Chee Wei at [35]`
#### EXCEPTIONS to Parole Evidence Rule
Extrinsic evidence can introduce OTHER express terms to the written contract.
* EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE **not inconsistent with a contract's existing terms** may be used to ==prove another document's validity==.
	1. *the existence of any **separate oral agreement**, as to ==any matter on which a document is silent== and which is ==not inconsistent with its terms, may be proved==; in considering whether or not this proviso applies, the court shall have regard to the degree of formality of the document*
		* `Section 94(b) of Evidence Act`
	* ==Illustrated in== `Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston [2000]`
	* ==Precluded by== an appropriately worded *ENTIRE AGREEMENT CLAUSE* (EAC) in `Lee Chee Wei at [31]-[35]`
* EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE may be used to ==prove another document as the contract's **condition precedents**==.
	1. *the existence of any **separate oral agreement** constituting a ==condition precedent to the attaching of any obligation== under any such contract, grant or disposition of property, **may be proved*** 
		* `Section 94(c) of Evidence Act`
	* ==Precluded by== an appropriately worded *ENTIRE AGREEMENT CLAUSE* (EAC)
