# Contract law
* **Legally enforcable agreement** made between parties under obligations within the contract.
* A person who breaks a contract must pay damages *(compensation)*.
* Oftentimes can be represented by the `sale`/`transaction` of an item.

# Tort law
* **Civil wrongs** that are NOT breach of contract. 
    * Important to note that civil wrongs can ALSO be breach of contract.
* A person who commits a tort must pay damages.

## 1. Tort of negligence
Being less careful than legally required in certain circumstances, violating the *duty of care*.

> Duty of care: Duty to be careful that is universal.

### Example
A commits the tort of negligence when:
* A owes a duty of care to B, to take a certain amount of care to avoid harming B 
* A breaches that duty, by not taking enough care
* A thereby causes harm to B

* Who defendant? *Stevenson --> Manafacturer*
* What courts heard && ruled on the dispute?

#### What happen?

* Donoghue was gifted the snail beer, therefore not binded by contract.

* Matter handled out of court.

#### What did big man say about it?

##### Lord Buckmaster
* 'Stevenson is not liable to Donoghue.'
* 'We can't change the law just cuz the plaintiff is sympathetic, must follow OG principles'

* Deio-Christian idea of the `neighbour` principle

> Lurking behind many court decisions are the base philosphocal positions and understanding of other implications that each judge takes.
