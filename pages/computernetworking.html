        <h1><code>Computer networking</code></h1>
<p>The practice of connecting computing devices to share resources and communicate across local and wide area networks.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer networking</strong> enables communication between computing devices</li>
<li>Fundamental to modern computing: internet, cloud services, distributed systems</li>
<li>Involves hardware (routers, switches, cables) and software (protocols, applications)</li>
<li>Spans from local connections to global internet infrastructure</li>
<li>Enables resource sharing, data exchange, and collaborative computing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Network Models</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># ----- OSI MODEL (7 LAYERS) -----
    # Conceptual framework for understanding network communication
    # Each layer provides services to the layer above
    # Abstraction allows independent development of layer technologies

</code></pre>

<h2>Network Security</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># ----- FIREWALL TYPES -----

# PACKET FILTERING FIREWALLS
    # Examine packets at network layer (Layer 3)
    # Allow/deny based on IP addresses, ports, protocols
    # Stateless: each packet evaluated independently
    # Fast but limited inspection capabilities

# STATEFUL FIREWALLS
    # Track connection state (TCP handshake status)
    # Make decisions based on connection context
    # More secure than packet filtering
    # Can detect connection hijacking attempts

# APPLICATION LAYER FIREWALLS
    # Deep packet inspection at application layer
    # Understand application protocols (HTTP, FTP, DNS)
    # Can block specific content or application features
    # Higher CPU overhead but better security

# ----- NETWORK ATTACKS -----

# MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MITM)
    # Attacker intercepts communication between parties
    # ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi hotspots
    # Prevention: encryption, certificate validation

# DDoS (DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE)
    # Overwhelming target with traffic from multiple sources
    # Volume attacks (UDP floods), protocol attacks (SYN flood)
    # Application layer attacks (HTTP floods)
    # Mitigation: rate limiting, traffic filtering, CDNs

# NETWORK SCANNING
    # Port scanning to find open services
    # Network reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery
    # Nmap tool for network discovery and security auditing
    # Defense: intrusion detection systems, port filtering

# ----- ENCRYPTION AND VPN -----

# SSL/TLS
    # Secure communication over insecure networks
    # Public key cryptography for key exchange
    # Symmetric encryption for data transfer
    # Certificate authorities validate server identity

# VPN (VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK)
    # Secure tunnel over public networks
    # IPSec =&gt; network layer VPN protocol
    # OpenVPN =&gt; application layer VPN solution
    # Site-to-site and remote access VPN configurations

<pre class="codehilite"><code># ----- PERFORMANCE METRICS -----

# BANDWIDTH
    # Maximum data transfer rate of network link
    # Measured in bits per second (bps, Kbps, Mbps, Gbps)
    # Theoretical vs actual throughput differences
    # Shared vs dedicated bandwidth considerations

# LATENCY
    # Time delay for data to travel from source to destination
    # Round-trip time (RTT) for bidirectional communication
    # Components: propagation, transmission, processing, queuing delays
    # Critical for real-time applications (VoIP, gaming, video conferencing)

# PACKET LOSS
    # Percentage of packets that fail to reach destination
    # Causes: network congestion, faulty equipment, interference
    # Impact on TCP (retransmission) vs UDP (lost data)

<pre class="codehilite"><code># ----- DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS -----

# PING
    # Tests connectivity and measures round-trip time
    # Uses ICMP Echo Request/Reply messages
    # Basic connectivity verification and latency measurement
    # Limitations: firewalls may block ICMP traffic

# TRACEROUTE
    # Maps network path from source to destination
    # Shows each hop (router) along the path
    # Identifies where connectivity issues occur
    # TTL manipulation to discover intermediate routers

# NETSTAT
    # Displays active network connections and listening ports
    # Shows routing table and interface statistics
