        <h1><code>DevOps</code></h1>
<p>Culture, practices, and tools that combine software development and IT operations to shorten development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DevOps</strong> bridges the gap between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) teams</li>
<li>Emphasizes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility</li>
<li>Focuses on automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery</li>
<li>Aims to increase deployment frequency while maintaining stability and security</li>
<li>Cultural shift toward shared ownership of the entire application lifecycle</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># ----- COLLABORATION -----
    # Break down silos between development and operations
    # Shared responsibility for application performance and reliability  
    # Cross-functional teams working toward common goals
    # Regular communication and feedback loops

# ----- AUTOMATION -----
    # Automate repetitive tasks to reduce human error
    # Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent environments
    # Automated testing throughout the pipeline
    # Automated deployment and rollback procedures

# ----- CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT -----
    # Iterative development and deployment processes
    # Regular retrospectives and process optimization
    # Monitoring and metrics-driven decisions
    # Learning from failures and near-misses

# ----- CUSTOMER-CENTRIC -----
    # Focus on delivering value to end users
    # Rapid feedback incorporation
    # Shorter time-to-market for features
    # Improved reliability and user experience
</code></pre>

<h2>CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># ----- CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI) -----
    # Developers integrate code changes frequently (multiple times per day)
    # Automated builds triggered by code commits
    # Comprehensive test suites run automatically
    # Quick feedback on code quality and functionality

# TYPICAL CI WORKFLOW:
    # 1. Developer commits code to version control (Git)
    # 2. CI server detects change and triggers build
    # 3. Code is compiled and unit tests executed  
    # 4. Static code analysis and security scans
    # 5. Integration tests run in clean environment
    # 6. Build artifacts stored in artifact repository
    # 7. Notifications sent to team about build status

# ----- CONTINUOUS DELIVERY (CD) -----
    # Extension of CI that automates deployment to staging/production
    # Code always in deployable state after passing CI
    # Automated deployment pipelines with approval gates
    # Blue-green or canary deployment strategies

# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
    # Blue-Green: Two identical environments, switch traffic instantly
    # Canary: Gradual rollout to subset of users/servers  
    # Rolling: Sequential update of servers in production
    # Feature Flags: Control feature visibility without deployment

# ----- PIPELINE TOOLS -----
    # Jenkins =&gt; open-source automation server with extensive plugins
    # GitLab CI =&gt; integrated with GitLab repositories
    # GitHub Actions =&gt; workflow automation directly in GitHub
    # Azure DevOps =&gt; Microsoft's comprehensive DevOps platform
    # CircleCI =&gt; cloud-native CI/CD platform
    # TeamCity =&gt; JetBrains' build management server
</code></pre>
