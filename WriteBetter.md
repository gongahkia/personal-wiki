# `Write better`

## Write better code

1. Read good code, which is 
    * Performant: time, space and memory-efficient for the task
    * Reliable: covers all cases
    * Maintainable: readable and easily modified a decade from writing
2. Practice writing code while remembering
    * Plan before program
    * Code readability > Novel tricks
    * Self-documenting code
    * Follow design patterns
    * Not necessarily about fewer lines of code
3. DRY: **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself
   * Not WET: **W**rite **E**verything **T**wice
4. TDD: **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment

## Write better literature

1. Refine your drafts until they're *sharp*
2. *Avoid* words that would not be used in everyday speech
3. All the writing in a piece (including digressions) serve *one unified purpose*
4. *Stop* when you know what comes next
