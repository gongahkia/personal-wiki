1. There's times when I feel like I'm not really sure who I am. It's like I'm battling with myself.  
2. In Japan, skateboarding is really frowned upon. Maybe because of that, having to overcome that, I think it made me a stronger person.  
3. Having trust in yourself is the most important thing. Having the confidence in yourself.  
4. I want to create something that people won't be able to forget. Something that can be passed on to the next generation.
5. Accomplish something that noone else has yet, is what I want to do next.

1. Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, in that case I’ve been paid
2. All of the young people, the artsy people, people who get overlooked because they’re weird or they don’t have hype around them, they need to get some shine.
3. Anything worth being, anything historical, anything new, anything impossible, all that shit takes sacrifice. And it takes risk. 
4. When you doing something creative and shit, and everything feels too easy, that's a red flag. That means its beneath you. You gotta go hard.
5. Keep hungry and motivated. There's always more you can do. The world is yours.
6. I want everybody to be their own pioneers. Dream big. If you're an outcast, be an outcast. If you fit in, fit in. Just be yourself.

1. A little ingredient that makes following your dreams a little more likely to work out is to ask yourself what's possible now that wasn't possible 10 years ago and which might get harder 10 years from now. There are more opportunities in a less crowded landscape. There are more chances to grow if you're part of a rising tide, but this requires pushing past the inevitable discomfort that comes from following a path that has little to no precedent.
2. The mechanism behind the exponential function is that it applies when the rate of change is proportional to the thing in and of itself. So it's like where software you write enables you to write more software. The things that you develop should enable increasingly greater development of those things.
3. My final piece of advice is to not treat passion as something to follow. Think of it as an initial velocity vector. It gives a clear direction to point yourself and loving what you do can have you move quickly. But you should expect and you should even hope that the specific direction that you're moving changes based on the force vectors around you.
