1. There's times when I feel like I'm not really sure who I am. It's like I'm battling with myself.  
2. In Japan, skateboarding is really frowned upon. Maybe because of that, having to overcome that, I think it made me a stronger person.  
3. Having trust in yourself is the most important thing. Having the confidence in yourself.  
4. I want to create something that people won't be able to forget. Something that can be passed on to the next generation.
5. Accomplish something that noone else has yet, is what I want to do next.

1. Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, in that case I’ve been paid
2. All of the young people, the artsy people, people who get overlooked because they’re weird or they don’t have hype around them, they need to get some shine.
3. Anything worth being, anything historical, anything new, anything impossible, all that shit takes sacrifice. And it takes risk. 
4. When you doing something creative and shit, and everything feels too easy, that's a red flag. That means its beneath you. You gotta go hard.
5. Keep hungry and motivated. There's always more you can do. The world is yours.
