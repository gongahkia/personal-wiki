Deep learning in Python.

## Introduction

### Definitions

1. Deep learning: program infers relationships between user-defined *inputs* and *outputs* (supervised learning)
2. Deep learning is good for 
    * problems with long lists of rules that would be difficult to hardcode
    * continually changing environments 
    * large unstructured datasets with unclear patterns
3. Deep learning is mostly achieved through a multilayered neural network *(hence deep)*
4. Neural networks work by
    1. **Input layer**: *inputs* are numerically encoded into multi-dimensional vectors
    2. **Hidden layer**: vectors are processed by the many hidden layers, program finds patterns in the vectors
    3. **Output layer**: *output* is returned in the form of multi-dimensional vectors
5. There are multiple types of neural networks
    * convolutional neural network (images)
    * transformer (NLP)
6. There are a few kinds of learning
    * supervised learning: BOTH *inputs* and *outputs* are specified for the program
    * unsupervised / self-supervised learning: ONLY *input* is specified for the program
    * transfer learning: one program's *output* is FED to another program as *input*
    * reinforcement learning: program is REWARDED for *ideal* behaviour and discouraged from *unideal* behaviour
7. General workflow of building a deep learning program is
    1. convert raw data to *input tensors*
    2. build a model
        * pick a loss function and optimizer
        * create the training loop
    3. tweak the model to fit the *data* and make a prediction with *output tensors*
    4. evaluate the model
    5. improve the model through iterative experimentation
    6. save and reload
8. Tensor: any numerical representation of data *(most commonly multi-dimensional vectors)*
9. There are different kinds of tensors
   1. scalar: a single number of *0 dimensions*
   2. vector: a number with a direction of *1 dimension*
   3. matrix: a *2-dimensional* array of numbers
   4. tensor: a *n-dimensional* array of numbers
10. Random tensors: important because neural networks take in tensors full of *random numbers* and then adjust those numbers via tensor operations (addition, subtraction, simple, element and matrix multiplication, division) to **better represent** data

### Tensor operations

```py
# ----- TENSOR OPERATIONS -----

# --- ARITHMETIC METHODS ---
    # + => addition applied to each element of the tensor
    # - => subtraction applied to each element of the tensor
    # * => simple multiplication of a matrix against a scalar number
    # / => division applied to each element of the tensor
    # * => ELEMENT multiplication of two matrices, where each element of a matrix is multipled against its corresponding element in the other matrix
    # torch.matmul() => MATRIX multiplication that finds the DOT PRODUCT of two specified matrices by multiplying them together
        # observe that matrix multiplication must satisfy the following 2 rules
            # 1. inner dimensions of the two matrices must match
                # torch.matmul(torch.rand(2, 3), torch.rand(2, 3)) WON'T work
                # torch.matmul(torch.rand(2, 3), torch.rand(3, 2)) WILL work
                # torch.matmul(torch.rand(3, 2), torch.rand(2, 3)) WILL work
            # 2. result matrix must have the shape of the outer dimensions
                # torch.matmul(torch.rand(2, 3), torch.rand(3, 2)) results in torch.Size([2, 2]) so this WILL work
                # torch.matmul(torch.rand(3, 2), torch.rand(2, 3)) results in torch.Size([3, 3]) so this WILL work

# --- AGGREGATOR METHODS ---
    # torch.min() => finds the element with the minimum value in a given tensor 
    # torch.max() => finds the element with the maximum value in a given tensor 
    # torch.mean() => finds the average value of all elements within a given tensor, note the element datatype must be a floating or complex type
    # torch.sum() => finds the sum of all elements within a given tensor
    # torch.argmin() => finds the index of the element with the minimum value in a given tensor 
    # torch.argmax() => finds the index of the element with the maximum value in a given tensor 

# --- MANIPULATION METHODS ---
    # one of the most common issues relating to tensors arises due to shape and dimension, which is combated by
        # reshaping => reshaping an input tensor to a specified shape
        # view => returns a view of an input tensor in a specified shape while pointing to the same place in memory as the original tensor
        # stacking => combine multiple tensors together in a vertical (vstack) or horizontal (hstack) stack
        # squeeze => remove all 1 dimensions from a given tensor
        # unsqueeze => add a 1 dimension to a given tensor
        # permute => returns a view of an input tensor with its dimensions swapped in a certain way
    # the PyTorch methods are as follows
        # .T => method that tranposes the shape of the specified tensor by switching its dimensions (axis), particularly useful for when tensor shape errors occur
        # .reshape() => method that reshapes a specified tensor to the new provided dimensions, note that the total corresponding number of elements must stay the same across a reshape
        # .view() => method that merely displays an existing tensor differenly according to the new provided dimensions whilst pointing to the original tensor's memory address (which means changing the new tensor variable assigned to a view changes the value of the original tensor being viewed)
        # torch.stack() => method that stacks multiple provided tensors together, with an optional dim argument that further allows augmentation of the desired number of dimensions within the new tensor
            # torch.vstack
            # torch.hstack
        # torch.squeeze() => method that removes all SINGLE dimensions from a given tensor
        # torch.unsqueeze() => method that adds a SINGLE dimension to a given tensor, with a dim argument that further specifies which dimension to add the single dimension at
        # torch.permute() => method that rearranges the dimensions of a given tensor to a new specified order and returns a VIEW of that new tensor (which means changing the new tensor variable assigned to a permute changes the value of the original tensor being permuted)

# --- SELECTION METHODS ---
    # [] => indexing in PyTorch is similar to indexing in Python and NumPy, where list values are zero-indexed and can have nested calls
    # : => specifies to select ALL of a given target dimension

# - NOTE -
    # recall that we have to reassign the result of a tensor operation to a variable for the value to be stored, similar to anywhere else in Python and most other programming languages really
    # the examples below are selected samples of the above methods and are not comprehensive, more detailed use cases can be found in PyTorch's documentation

import torch

# intialisation of tensor object literals
tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]) 
another_tensor = torch.tensor(
    [[7, 8],
    [9, 10],
    [11, 12]]
)
yet_another_tensor = torch.arange(1, 10) # initialises the tensor object literal tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
final_tensor = torch.arange(1, 10).reshape(1, 3, 3) # initialises the tensor object literal tensor([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]) 

tensor + 10 # addition that evaluates to the tensor object literal tensor([101, 102, 103])
tensor - 10 # subtraction that evaluates to the tensor object literal tensor([-9, -8, -7])
tensor * 10 # simple multiplication evaluates to the tensor object literal tensor([10, 20, 30])
tensor / 10 # divison evaluates to the tensor object literal tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])

tensor * tensor # element multiplication evaluates to the tensor object literal tensor([1, 4, 9])
torch.matmul(tensor, tensor) # matrix multiplication evalutes to the dot product value torch(14)

another_tensor.T # transpose operation that evaluates to the tensor object literal tensor([[7, 9, 11], [8, 10, 12]])
another_tensor.T.shape # transpose operation means this will now return the torch.Size([2, 3])

yet_another_tensor.shape # returns torch.Size([9])
reshaped_tensor = yet_another_tensor.reshape(9, 1)
reshaped_tensor.shape # returns torch.Size([9, 1])

view_tensor = yet_another_tensor.view(9, 1)
view_tensor.shape # returns torch.Size([9, 1]), but note that modifying view_tensor will also modify the value of yet_another_tensor

stack_tensor = torch.stack([yet_another_tensor, yet_another_tensor, yet_another_tensor, yet_another_tensor], dim = 0) # restacks the tensor according to dimension 0
stack_tensor = torch.stack([yet_another_tensor, yet_another_tensor, yet_another_tensor, yet_another_tensor], dim = 1) # restacks the tensor according to dimension 1

final_tensor.shape # unmodified tensor will return torch.Size([1, 3, 3])
final_tensor[0] # evaluates to tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
final_tensor[0][0] # evaluates to tensor([1, 2, 3])
final_tensor[0][0][0] # evaluates to tensor(1)
```

### PyTorch and NumPy

```py
# ----- NUMPY -----
    # torch.from_numpy() => receives NumPy data and converts it to a PyTorch tensor
    # torch.Tensor.numpy() => receives a PyTorch tensor and converts it to NumPy data
    # observe that NumPy's default datatype is float64 while PyTorch's default datatype is float32

import torch
import numpy

array = numpy.arange(1.0, 8.0) # initialise a NumPy array
tensor = torch.from_numpy(array) # convert that NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor
back_to_array = torch.Tensor.numpy(tensor) # converting that PyTorch tensor back to a NumPy array
```

### Reproducibility

Introduce a **random seed** to flavour the randomness of `torch.rand()`.

```py
# ----- REPRODUCIBILITY -----
    # torch.manual_seed() => sets the provided value as the seed for generating the next random tensor value to ensuring reproducibility
        # note that this method must be called EVERY TIME we want to invoke the torch.rand() method to reassign the user-defined seed value

import torch

RANDOM_SEED = 42
torch.manual_seed(RANDOM_SEED) # assign a seed value
random_tensor_1 = torch.rand(3, 4)
torch.manual_seed(RANDOM_SEED) # assign a seed value
random_tensor_2 = torch.rand(3, 4)

random_tensor_1 == random_tensor_2 # this evaluates to True
```

## Doing actual things with Tensors

*"Enough yapping, I want to build something."*

### Encode an Image to a Tensor

The model will be trained on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  

1. Split the image into its RGB *(red green blue)* color channels.
2. Represent that as a tensor with the shape *(`color_channels`, `image_height`, `image_width`)*.
3. Train the model using a basic convolutional neural network (CNN).
