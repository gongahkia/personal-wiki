        <h1><code>Differential Equations</code></h1>
<p>Notes on the 3Blue1Brown series, providing an intuition for what differential equations are and how to think about them.</p>
<h2>Introduction: The Language of Change</h2>
<p>Differential equations are the language used to describe change in the universe. Anytime a law of nature describes how a quantity changes over time or space, it is likely expressed as a differential equation.</p>
<p>A <strong>differential equation</strong> is an equation that relates a function to its derivatives. For example, an equation might connect the position of an object to its velocity (the first derivative of position) and its acceleration (the second derivative).</p>
<h2>The Essence of a Differential Equation</h2>
<p>The core idea of a differential equation is that it provides a rule for how a quantity changes at any given moment. Consider an equation of the form:<br />
$$<br />
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y, t)<br />
$$<br />
This equation tells you the rate of change of $y$ at any given time $t$ and for any value of $y$. A <strong>solution</strong> to the differential equation is a function $y(t)$ that satisfies this rule for all $t$.</p>
<h2>Geometric View: Slope Fields</h2>
<p>One of the most intuitive ways to understand a differential equation is to visualize it as a <strong>slope field</strong>.<br />
*   For an equation $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y, t)$, you can go to any point $(t, y)$ in the plane and draw a tiny arrow with the slope given by $f(y, t)$.<br />
*   This collection of arrows is the slope field. It gives you a sense of the flow or the dynamics of the system.<br />
*   A solution to the differential equation is a curve that "follows the arrows" – a curve that is tangent to the slope field at every point.</p>
<p>An <strong>initial condition</strong>, like $y(0) = y_0$, specifies a starting point for the curve.</p>
<h2>Numerical Approximation: Euler's Method</h2>
<p>While it can be difficult to find an exact formula for the solution, we can always approximate it numerically using the slope field. This is the idea behind <strong>Euler's method</strong>:<br />
1.  Start at an initial point $(t_0, y_0)$.<br />
2.  Choose a small step size, $\Delta t$.<br />
3.  Calculate the slope at the starting point: $m = f(y_0, t_0)$.<br />
4.  Approximate the change in $y$ as $\Delta y \approx m \cdot \Delta t$.<br />
5.  The new point is $(t_0 + \Delta t, y_0 + \Delta y)$.<br />
6.  Repeat this process from the new point.</p>
<p>This is like walking through the slope field, taking small, straight steps at each point, with the direction of the step given by the slope at that point.</p>
<h2>Systems of Equations and Phase Space</h2>
<p>Often, we have multiple quantities that change and depend on each other. This leads to a <strong>system of differential equations</strong>. A classic example is a predator-prey model, where the population of rabbits and foxes depend on each other.</p>
<p>To visualize such a system, we use a <strong>phase space</strong>.<br />
*   Each axis in the phase space represents one of the quantities (e.g., one axis for rabbits, one for foxes).<br />
*   A single point in the phase space represents the state of the entire system at a moment in time.<br />
*   The system of differential equations defines a <strong>vector field</strong> in this space. At each point, there is a vector that tells you how the state of the system is changing.<br />
*   A solution is a path through the phase space, following the vectors of the vector field.</p>
<h2>Linear Differential Equations</h2>
<p>A special and very important class of differential equations is <strong>linear differential equations</strong>, where the function and its derivatives appear linearly.</p>
<p>For systems of linear differential equations, the tools of linear algebra become essential. The concepts of <strong>eigenvectors</strong> and <strong>eigenvalues</strong> of the matrix representing the system tell you about the long-term behavior of the system (e.g., whether it will go to a stable point, or grow to infinity).</p>
