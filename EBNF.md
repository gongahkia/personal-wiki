Extended Backus-Naur Form is a notation *(metalanguage)* used to define a programming language's syntax.   

## Quickstart

```ebnf

    (* every widely used programming language today has an .ebnf file as universally-understandable documentation to describe language grammer *)
    (* ebnf syntax shares many similarities with regular expressions *)
    (* ::= => definition operator that functions similarly to the assignment operator in other languages *)
    (* | => alternative operator that functions similarly to the or operator *)
