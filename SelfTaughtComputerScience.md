# `Self-taught Computer Science`

Anyone can learn Computer Science.  
  
## Curriculum

I based the curriculum on [this reference material](#reference-material).  
  
This curriculum [does not cover](#not-covered) all that a CS degree in school will give you, but I found learning these topics essential in getting me up and running quickly as a programmer.
  
It might work for you, it might not.  
  
Go as deep as you want and stop when you want to.  

Do not be afraid to google.
  
All the best.
