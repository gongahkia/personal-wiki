## Introduction

I based the curriculum on [this reference material](#reference-material).  

It [does not cover](#not-covered) all that a CS degree in school will give you, but I found the below topics essential in getting me up and writing code as quickly as possible.  
  
This syllabus might work for you, it might not.  
  
Go as deep as you want and stop when you want.  

Do not be afraid to google.
  
All the best.  

## Curriculum
