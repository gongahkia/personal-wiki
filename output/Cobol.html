<h1 id="cobol"><code>COBOL</code></h1>
<p>Business-oriented language created in 1960 for enterprise and financial applications.</p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- COMMENT -----

* this is a single-line comment
*&gt; this is an alternative valid syntax for single-line comments

* there is no default COBOL implementation
* for multi-line comments
* but writing them like this
* achieves the same effect</code></pre>
<h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>
<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- PRINTING -----
    * DISPLAY =&gt; takes whitespace-delimited string argument(s) that are printed to the stdout and includes a newline by default

DISPLAY &quot;hello, this is a COBOL program&quot;.
DISPLAY &quot;name: &quot; WS-NAME &quot; age: &quot; WS-AGE. * this assumes the variables have already been declared and initialised within the DATA DIVISON</code></pre>
<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- QUICKSTART -----
    * english-like Common Business Oriented Language
    * imperative, procedural and supports object oriented programming paradigms
    * every line in COBOL is . period delimited, equivalent to the ; semicolon in other programming languages
    * every COBOL program is structured into the following divisions
        * IDENTIFICATION DIVISION =&gt; stores COBOL program metadata 
            * PROGRAM-ID =&gt; takes a string argument that specifies the COBOL program name
            * identification division also stores other data like AUTHOR, INSTALLATION, DATE-WRITTEN and DATE-COMPILED
        * DATA DIVISION =&gt; used for declaration and initialisation of variables, constants, and data structures that the program will use
            * WORKING-STORAGE SECTION =&gt; specifies declaration of variables and constants with immutable values
            * FILE SECTION =&gt; designates the file structures and data files used by the COBOL program
            * LOCAL-STORAGE SECTION =&gt; similar to WORKING-STORAGE but stores declaration of variables that are reinitialized whenever the given COBOL program is invoked
            * LINKAGE SECTION =&gt; specifies data items that can be passed between programs or different parts of the same program
        * PROCEDURE DIVISION =&gt; contains the actual programe execution code, acting as the equivalent of the main function in other languages
            * procedure division consists of a series of procedures comprised of paragraphs and sections that segment and organise main COBOL program logic
                * section: groups of related paragraphs
                * paragraph: named block of code within the PROCEDURE DIVISION
            * STOP RUN =&gt; equivalent of the exit keyword in Python, where the COBOL program will cease running immediately when STOP RUN is hit, called within the procedure division

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
    PROGRAM-ID. SampleProgram.

DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        01 WS-NAME PIC X(20) VALUE &#39;John Doe&#39;.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.

    DISPLAY &quot;Program Ending...&quot;.
    STOP RUN.</code></pre>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- TYPE -----
    * INTEGER =&gt; stores an integer value
    * FLOATING-POINT =&gt; stores a floating-point value with the specified decimal precision
    * CHARACTER =&gt; stores a single character
    * ALPHABETIC =&gt; stores a series of alphabetic characters as a string of specified length
    * ALPHANUMERIC =&gt; stores a series of alphanumeric characters as a string of specified length
    * BOOLEAN =&gt; &#39;0&#39; for false, &#39;1&#39; for true
    * DATE =&gt; stores a date value in YYYYMMDD format
    * TIME =&gt; stores a time value in HHMMSS format
    * TIMESTAMP =&gt; stores a timestamp value comprising both date and time
    * POINTER =&gt; stores a memory address in the form of a pointer, similar to pointers in other programming languages 
    * NATIONAL =&gt; stores a series of national characters such as Unicode
    * DISPLAY =&gt; stores numeric values with leading spaces supressed
    * COMP =&gt; stores binary data
    * COMP-3 =&gt; stores packed decimal data, enabling further compacted storage for performance</code></pre>

<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- OPERATOR -----

* --- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ---

ADD * addition
SUBTRACT * subtraction
MULTIPLY * multiplication

EQUAL TO * partial equality check for equality in value but not type
NOT EQUAL TO * partial inequality check for inequality in value but not type
GREATER THAN * comparison operator

<h2 id="control-structures">Control Structures</h2>
<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- CONTROL STRUCTURE -----

* --- CONDITIONALS ---

* IF ELSE IF ELSE END-IF
    * note the necessary inclusion of the end-if similar to Bash

IF WS-AGE &gt;= 18 * assume these variables have been defined earlier in DATA DIVISION
    DISPLAY &quot;Adult&quot;
ELSE IF WS-AGE &gt;= 13
    DISPLAY &quot;Teenager&quot;
ELSE
    DISPLAY &quot;Child&quot;
END-IF

* --- LOOPS ---
    * PERFORM =&gt; declares creation of a while loop in your COBOL program and prefixes that loop&#39;s code
        * PERFORM UNTIL &lt;whileLoopPredicateCondition&gt; =&gt; specifies creation of while loop that runs infinitely until the specified predicate condition is hit
        * PERFORM &lt;integerNumber&gt; TIMES =&gt; specifies creation of a loop that iterates the specified number of times before automatically exiting and continuing with the below code after the designated number has been hit
    * END-PERFORM =&gt; suffixes the previously declared while loop&#39;s code
    * note that COBOL does not have an explicit for-in or for-each loop construct that allows direct iteration over elements within an iterable structure

PERFORM UNTIL WS-COUNTER &gt; 5
    DISPLAY &quot;Counter: &quot; WS-COUNTER
    ADD 1 TO WS-COUNTER
END-PERFORM

PERFORM 5 TIMES
    DISPLAY &quot;Counter: &quot; WS-COUNTER
    ADD 1 TO WS-COUNTER
END-PERFORM</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h2>
<pre class="cobol"><code>* ----- DATA STRUCTURE -----
    * TABLE =&gt; dynamically-sized ordered collection of elements of the same datatype, the equivalent of an array in other programming languages and tables in Lua
    * RECORD =&gt; user-defined collection of fields with specified datatypes allowing the modelling of logically-related data, the equivalent of structs in Typescript and Go via type aliases

01 WS-TABLE.
    05 WS-ELEMENT OCCURS 10 TIMES PIC X(10).

01 WS-EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
    05 WS-EMPLOYEE-ID    PIC 9(5).
