### General overview

* The legal process puts multiple *protective mechanisms* in place to prevent **arbitrary exercise of power** *(such as a sole police officer/ victim)* in the process of an investigation.   
* Only those in **High Office** *(Attorney General)*

#### Criminal Justice Process

1. Reporting of a crime
2. *Judge, Lawyer, everyone all shouts at each other* üó£Ô∏è
3. Final disposition of the case against the accused for the commission of the offence *(send you go jail)*

---

### 2 Models of Criminal Justice

Singapore adopts a ***hybrid model*** that incorporates both. 

| Crime Control Model | Due Process Model |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| *The repression of criminal conduct is by far the most important function.* | *Primacy to an individual's rights as opposed to the rights of the community as a whole.* |

### Jury trials vs Bench trials

<img src="https://www.blankmediagames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-judgement.jpg" align="right" height="200px"/>

#### Jury trials

* **Jury trials** are to make findings of fact based on evidence, and the Jury has to make their final decision **based on the law**. *(It is **not** a purely subjective decision.)*  

> The Jury does **not** need to explain their decision. 

#### Bench trials

* **Bench trials** are where Judges provide the final verdict for a given case.

> Bench trials **require** Judges to explain their decision based off the law.

* **Overseas**, there is greater skepticism towards those who hold power *(impression that the elite ruling class who rise to positions like Judge)*, and **Jury trials** are preferred.
* As such, it becomes more of a *political issue* of power held by the state, as opposed to whether a Jury trial actually holds the Jury accountable *(psst, it doesn't to an extent)*.

> Singapore adopts a **Bench trial** model, though in the past, we have tested jury trials for a period *(they were shit)*.

### Power vs Permission

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L53gjP-TtGE/maxresdefault.jpg" height="200px" align="right"/>

Power:  
* ability to infringe on another's rights *(Police is able to coerce and compel individuals to comply with their investigation)*

Permission:  
* a person gives you the permission *(within their set limits)* to infringe on their rights

---

#### Powers of investigation:

* Power to require production of document/thing *`s20, CPC`*  
* Power to require attendance *`s21, CPC`*  
* Power to examine witness orally via interview *`s22, CPC`*  
* Power to search and seize *`s24-40, CPC`*  

*Note that even in this power, the Police are surrounded by limitations on their exercise of power.*

* `Section 2(1)` Police need to adhere to *Arrestable* (`s16, cpc`) vs *Non-arrestable* (`s17, cpc`) cases && note whether they require an **arrest warrant**

* `Section 21(1)` Police require a **written order** to compel a Witness' attendance at a public hearing, and police must **report to Magistrate** should said witness not attend (`s21(2), cpc`)
 
* `Section 22(1-3)` Police have limitations in their power regarding **power to examine witness**, and (`s22(4), cpc`) to ensure the witness is aware their **witness testimony** is legally binding *(with reference to `s258(1), cpc`)*
> Great emphasis is placed on ***oral testimony*** in trials, since *cross-examination* is the **litmus test** for any oral testimony.

* Police have limitations on their power to **arrest without warrant** (`s64, cpc`), **arrest for non-arrestable offence** (`s65, cpc`), **arrest by private person** (`s66, cpc`)

* Police have limitations on their power to **detain an individual** withou warrant (`s68, cpc`)

Additionally, there are further limitations on the proceedings of detainment of an individual.

* Release of arrested persons on bond or on bail (`s85, cpc`)
* ***Cautioned statement*** outlining the **offence** and **indication for defense** (`s23(1), cpc`)

> Different *non-police* law enforcement agencies have different powers and provisions **(CNB, CPIB, ICA, Customs)**.

<img src="https://cdn1.dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/09105250/4-amongus-pink-dead-brown-watching_ccexpress.png" height="200px" align="right"/>

#### Parties to criminal proceedings

* Public prosecutor ***(pp lol)***
* Accused *(defense)*
* Private persons in a Magistrate's complaint (`s151(1), cpc`)

#### General procedure

1. Initiating criminal proceedings `s150, cpc`  

    * *Note that this means criminal proceedings have been **initiated** once you receive that letter to come to court for failing to pay parking ticket.*

        > *Criminal proceedings against any person may be initiated pursuant to an arrest, a summons, an arrest warrant, a notice to attend court or any other mode for compelling the attendance of a person in court which is provided for under this Code or any other written law, as the case may be.*

2. Public prosecutor's limits on power

    * `s10, cpc`: Prosecution of offences that require consent of **PP**
    * `s11, cpc`: Attorney General is the **PP**
    * `Article 35(8) of Constitution`: Attorney General is yielded the highest power to carry out any actions at their discretion

        >  The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.

    * `s11(5), cpc`: Another person can be appointed as the **PP**

3. Limits on the extent on Bail
    
    * `s92(1), cpc`: Person accused of bailable offence should be offered that option  
    * `s93(1), cpc`: Discretionary bail offered to person accused of non-bailable offence  
    * `s95(1), cpc`: No bail conditions offered to persons accused of certain offences
