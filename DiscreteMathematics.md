### Definitions

1. $\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of *all* negative and positive integers
    * $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
2. $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of *all* natural numbers (aka. non-negative integers)
    * non-negative integers: positive integers and zero
    * $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
3. $\mathbb{Z}^+$ or $\mathbb{N}^+$ denotes the set of *all* positive integers
    * positive integer: integer greater than zero
    * $\mathbb{Z}^+ = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
    * $\mathbb{N}^+ = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
4. $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the set of *all* rational numbers
    * rational numbers: set of fractions $\frac{p}{q}$ where $q$ can't be zero **and** two fractions are the same number if they are the same when reduced to lowest terms
5. $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the set of *all* real numbers
    * real numbers: rational numbers **and** irrational numbers
    * irrational numbers: eg. $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $e$ **and** assuming that $\sqrt{x}$ only returns the positive square root of $x$
6. $\mathbb{C}$ denotes the set of *all* complex numbers
    * complex numbers: numbers of the form $a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers **and** $i=\sqrt{-1}$
7. Infinity is not a number in standard mathematics.
8. $\in$ denotes membership to a set
    * eg. $x \in \mathbb{R}$ denotes $x$ is a real number
9. $\notin$ denotes absence from a set
    * eg. $y \notin \mathbb{Z}$ denotes $y$ is not an integer

To select a limited range of real numbers, we use an interval of the real line.

10. $[$ $]$ denotes a closed interval that is **inclusive** of its upper and lower bound
    * eg. $[a, b]$ denotes a set of all real numbers from $a$ to $b$, including $a$ and $b$
11. $($ $)$ denotes an open interval that is **exclusive** of its upper and lower bound
    * eg. $(a, b)$ denotes a set of all real numbers from $a$ to $b$, not including $a$ and $b$
12. $[$ $)$ and $($ $]$ both denote half-open intervals that are **inclusive** of one bound and **exclusive** of the other bound
    * $[a, b)$ and $(a, b]$ denote sets of real numbers from $a$ to $b$ that include either $a$ or $b$
