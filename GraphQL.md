# `GraphQL`

API-specific query language as a flexible alternative to traditional RESTful APIs.

## Capabilities

1. Single endpoint: one endpoint for all queries and mutations, enabling quicker optimisation and management
2. Efficient queries: exact query data can be requested from nested structures, preventing over-fetching or under-fetching 
3. Strong type system: strongly typed schema prevents misqueries between the client and server

## Applications

1. Application development: mobile and web apps for fetching and updating only the necessary server data and providing real-time updates while reducing network overhead
2. Microservices: effiicently aggregates data across multiple microservices
