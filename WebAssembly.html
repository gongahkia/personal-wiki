<h1><code>Web Assembly</code></h1>
<p>Binary instruction format enabling high-performance code across many browser platforms.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<pre><code class="language-wast">;; ----- COMMENT -----

;; this is a single-line comment 

;; there is no built-in implementation 
;; for multi-line comments in web assembly
;; but the same effect can be achieved as seen
;; here
</code></pre>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<pre><code class="language-wast">;; ----- QUICKSTART -----
    ;; designed to provide a portable compilation target for web browsers, with increasing adoption by modern browser engines
    ;; note that web assembly has multiple representative formats with their own file extensions
        ;; .wasm =&gt; web assembly binary format, used for direct execution by web assembly engines and for transmission over networks
        ;; .wat =&gt; web assembly text format, transcription of the .wasm format into text, closely mimicking .wasm's semantics
        ;; .wast =&gt; superset of .wat, providing a further abstracted higher-level textual representation of web assembly code (covered in this document)

;; --- SYNTAX OVERVIEW ---
    ;; export =&gt; specifies the name for which a given entity (such as a function, memory, table, global) is exported by, under which it can then be accessed as a module in JavaScript or via other web assembly modules
    ;; module =&gt; imports standard library and user-defined modules into the local scope of the present file, including their corresponding functionality 
    ;; local =&gt; defines local variables with a specified name for use within a locally scoped variable, often used within functions, whose values can be reassigned after initial assignment
    ;; global =&gt; defines global variable with a specified name for use within the global scope of the program, whose values can be reassigned after initial assignment
    ;; .set =&gt; assigns a value to a previously defined variable or global
    ;; .get =&gt; retrieves a value from a previously defined and assigned variable or global
    ;; .const =&gt; defines constants whose value cannot be reassigned after initial assignment
    ;; mut =&gt; specifies a given local or global variable whose value can be reassigned after initial declaration
    ;; $ =&gt; prefixes all variable and constant names, similar to PHP's variable declaration

;; --- PRINTING ---
    ;; web assembly does not have direct printing capabilities to the stdout as in other conventional programming languages
    ;; instead, web assembly modules interact directly with their host environments such as web browsers or servers
    output is handled via host environments such as JavaScript

<h2>Types</h2>
<pre><code class="language-wast">;; ----- TYPE -----
    ;; i32 =&gt; 32-bit signed integer
    ;; i64 =&gt; 64-bit signed integer
    ;; f32 =&gt; 32-bit single-precision floating-point number
    ;; f64 =&gt; 64-bit double-precision floating-point number
    ;; memory =&gt; stores raw bytes in linear memory, defined with the initial and maximum allocated size in bytes
</code></pre>
<h2>Operators</h2>
<pre><code class="language-wast">;; ----- OPERATOR -----

;; --- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ---

.add ;; addition
.sub ;; subtraction
.mul ;; multiply
.div ;; unsigned division 
.div_s ;; signed division 
.rem ;; unsigned modulo
.rem_s ;; signed modulo

;; --- COMPARISON OPERATORS ---

.eq ;; complete equality check for both value and type
.ne ;; complete inequality check for both value and type
.lt ;; less than for unsigned comparisons

.ge_s ;; greater than or equal for signed comparisons

;; --- BITWISE (LOGICAL) OPERATORS ---

.and ;; bitwise and
.or ;; bitwise or
.xor ;; bitwise xor
.eqz ;; bitwise not (wherein eqz checks if the specified value is equal to zero)

<h2>Control structures</h2>
<pre><code class="language-wast">;; ----- CONTROL STRUCTURE -----

;; --- CONDITIONALS ---

;; IF THEN ELSE 
    ;; note that web assembly does not provide a elseif construct as in other languages
    ;; instead, the same effect can be achieved with nested if else loops as seen below

(if (result i32)
    (i32.eq (local.get $a) (i32.const 0)) 
(then
    (i32.const 1) 
)
(else
    (i32.const 0) 
)
)

(if (result i32)
(i32.eq (local.get $a) (i32.const 0)) 
(then
    (i32.const 1) 
)
(else
    (if (result i32)
    (i32.eq (local.get $a) (i32.const 1))

    )
    (else
        (i32.const 0) 
    )
    )
)

;; --- LOOPS ---
    ;; note that web assembly does not provide default for, foreach and while loop constructs as in other programming languages
    ;; instead, these higher-level loops can be created and user-defined using the loop keyword
    ;; loop =&gt; specifies the beginning of a loop construct, the equivalent of the loop keyword construct in Rust
    ;; br &lt;labelName&gt; =&gt; branch, used to unconditionally jump to the specified label within the current function or codeblock
    ;; br_if &lt;labelName&gt; (&lt;specifiedPredicateCondition&gt;) =&gt; branch if, used to indicate a conditional jump to the specified label within the current function or codeblock if the specified predicate condition is fulfilled
    ;; nop =&gt; no operation, used as a placeholder and the equivalent of pass in other programming languages like Python

(loop $loopLabel
    (i32.const 0) 
    (local.get $counter) 
    (i32.eqz) 
    (br_if $loopEnd) 
    (i32.const 1) 
    (local.set $counter) 
    (br $loopLabel) 
    (nop)
