----------

### General overview

* The legal process puts multiple *protective mechanisms* in place to prevent **arbitrary exercise of power** *(such as a sole police officer/ victim)* in the process of an investigation.   
* Only those in **High Office** *(Attorney General)*

#### Criminal Justice Process

1. Reporting of a crime
2. *Judge, Lawyer, everyone all shouts at each other* 🗣️
3. Final disposition of the case against the accused for the commission of the offence *(send you go jail)*

### 2 Models of Criminal Justice

| Crime Control Model | Due Process Model |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| *The repression of criminal conduct is by far the most important function.* | *Primacy to an individual's rights as opposed to the rights of the community as a whole.* |

Singapore adopts a ***hybrid model*** that incorporates both.

### Jury trials vs Bench trials

##### Jury trials:

* **Jury trials** are to make findings of fact based on evidence, and the Jury has to make their final decision **based on the law**. *(It is **not** a purely subjective decision.)*  

> The Jury does **not** need to explain their decision. 

##### Bench trials:

* **Bench trials** are where Judges provide the final verdict for a given case.

> Bench trials **require** Judges to explain their decision based off the law.

* **Overseas**, there is greater skepticism towards those who hold power *(impression that the elite ruling class who rise to positions like Judge)*, and **Jury trials** are preferred.
* As such, it becomes more of a *political issue* of power held by the state, as opposed to whether a Jury trial actually holds the Jury accountable *(psst, it doesn't to an extent)*.

Singapore adopts a **Bench trial** model, though in the past, we have tested jury trials for a period *(they were shit)*.

### Power vs Permission

Power:  
* ability to infringe on another's rights *(Police is able to coerce and compel individuals to comply with their investigation)*

Permission:  
* a person gives you the permission *(within their set limits)* to infringe on their rights

#### Powers of investigation:

> Power to require production of document/thing *`s20, CPC`*  

> Power to require attendance *`s21, CPC`*  

> Power to examine witness orally via interview *`s22, CPC`*  

> Power to search and seize *`s24-40, CPC`*  

*Note that even in this power, the Police are surrounded by limitations on their exercise of power.*

* `Section 2(1)` Police need to adhere to *Arrestable* (`s16, cpc`) vs *Non-arrestable* (`s17, cpc`) cases && note whether they require an **arrest warrant**

* `Section 21(1)` Police require a **written order** to compel a Witness' attendance at a public hearing, and police must **report to Magistrate** should said witness not attend (`s21(2), cpc`)
 
* `Section 22(1-3)` Police have limitations in their power regarding **power to examine witness**, and (`s22(4), cpc`) to ensure the witness is aware their **witness testimony** is legally binding *(with reference to `s258(1), cpc`)*
> Great emphasis is placed on ***oral testimony*** in trials, since *cross-examination* is the **litmus test** for any oral testimony.

* Police have limitations on their power to **arrest without warrant** (`s64, cpc`), **arrest for non-arrestable offence** (`s65, cpc`), **arrest by private person** (`s66, cpc`)

* Police have limitations on their power to **detain an individual** withou warrant (`s68, cpc`)

Additionally, there are further limitations on the proceedings of detainment of an individual.

* Release of arrested persons on bond or on bail (`s85, cpc`)
* ***Cautioned statement*** outlining the **offence** and **indication for defense** (`s23(1), cpc`)

> Different *non-police* law enforcement agencies have different powers and provisions **(CNB, CPIB, ICA, Customs)**.
