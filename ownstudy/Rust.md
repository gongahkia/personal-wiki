### What is Rust?

Rust is a **strongly** and **statically-typed** compiled language.

> Add what Rust is used for in the industry today.

### Quick start

#### Installation

Refer [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for instructions on installation to your respective machine.

#### Usage

Rust files end with the `.rs` extension.

1. `rustc`
    * Calls the ***Rust compiler*** that compiles our program, creating a **binary executable file**.
        > The binary executable will be created with the same name as your Rust file/ Rust package.

```console
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
```

---

***Larger Rust projects*** with multiple dependencies should be initialized with Rust's build feature, `cargo`.

2. `cargo`
    * `cargo new {project name}` creates a new Rust package.
        > All Rust program code is written inside the `main.rs` file *(found inside the `src` folder)*.

```console
$ cargo new exampleProject
```
3. `cargo build` 
    * **Compiles** and **builds** the Rust project *(creating the corresponding executable file)*.
        > The executable file can be found inside the `/target/debug` file path.

```console
$ cargo build
$ cd target/debug
$ ./exampleProject
```

4. `cargo run` 
    * Immediately **compiles** and **runs** the Rust program *(used for quick checks when writing a Rust program)*.

```console
$ cargo run
```

5. `cargo check` 
    * **Checks** whether the Rust program can **compile without errors** *(without actually compiling the Rust program)*.

```console
$ cargo check
```

### Printing to the console && Comments

All Rust code to be executed is placed within the `fn main()` main function *(similar to C and Java)*.

* `println!()` **prints** text to the console
* `//` prefixes any **comments** in Rust
* `{}` used to embed variables and values in **formatted strings** *(similar to Bash)*

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
} // and this is a comment

let x:i32 = 40;
println!("x is: {}", x); // formatted strings in Rust look like this
```

> `!` bang character => Rust **Macro** *(elaborated on later)*

### Variables && Constants

> ***~Cardinal Rule No. 1 ðŸ§›~***   
> Variables in Rust are ***immutable*** by default.

* `let` declares and creates a variable *(explicitly declare the variable's data type with a `:` colon)*.
* `mut` keyword indicates that a variable is **mutable** *(its value can now be changed later in the program)*.

```Rust
let x:i32 = 10; // variable values are immutable by default

let mut y:i32 = 45; // mut creates a mutable variable
y = 100;
println!("y is: {}:, y");
```

* `const` declares and creates a **constant**, whose **value** and **data type** cannot be changed throughout the program

```Rust
const SECONDS_IN_MINUTES:u32 = 60;
println!("{}", SECONDS_IN_MINUTES);
```

### Data types

#### Primitive data types

* `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128` 
    * Signed integer *(positive or negative)* 
    * the number indicates the **number of bits** the given integer can take up in memory  
  
* `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`
    * Unsigned integer *(always positive)* 
    > for the same number of bits in memory, an unsigned integer can represent a **larger range of positive numbers** than a signed integer  

* `f32`, `f64` 
    * Floats 
    * `f32` is **single precision**, `f64` is **double precision**  

* `bool`
    * Boolean
    * `true` represented by 0, `false` represented by 1  

* `char`
    * Character
    * single characters are surrounded by `''` *single quotation marks*  

#### Data structures

* String
> *add more notes on this later from Rust book*

* Tuple `({data types of values within tuple})`
    * **fixed length** sequence of elements *(that can be of different data types)*  
    * values in a tuple can be accessed by *index* via `.` **dot notation**

```Rust
let eg_tuple:(i32, bool, char) = (1, true, 'A');
println!("{}", eg_tuple.1); // this would print out true to the console, which has an index of 1
```

* Array `[{data type of values within array};{number of values within array}]`
    * **fixed length** sequence of elements *(that are all of the same data type)*  
    * values in an array can be accessed by *index* via `[]` **square bracket notation**

```Rust
let eg_array:[i32; 10] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
println!("{}", eg_array[7]); // this would print out the integer 8 to the console, which has an index of 7
```

### User input

**User input** in Rust is handled by the *io module* under the standard namespace, and is imported with `use std::io`.

* `io::stdin()` and `.read_line()` method is called to **accept user input** from the console *(standard input)*, and **store** it within the String variable

```Rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Type something: ");
    let mut input = String::new(); // declares and creates a new empty mutable string variable
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input);
}
```
