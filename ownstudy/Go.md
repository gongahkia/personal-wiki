## What is Go?

Go is a **statically typed**, **compiled** programming language.

## Quick start

### [Installation](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### Usage

Go files end with the `.go` extension.

#### `go build`
* compiles a `.go` file and creates an **executable file** *(run using `./` syntac)*

```console
$ go build exampleProj.go
$ ./exampleProj
```

#### `go run`
* compiles and runs a `.go` file immediately *(without creating an executable file)*

```console
$ go run anotherExampleProj.go
```

## I love Go <3

### Important to establish

All Go code to be executed is enclosed within the **main function** (`func main()`) *(similar to C++, C, Rust)* since Go was written by [Ken Thompson](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRjrz1f8bWO6ehJTtO6Rh7A0dmt_lTnHYU7QzuMr9YneH0FqSqwx9fYVg-wKFG21jvybPQ&usqp=CAU), the Goat who tested C and C++.

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world!")
}
```
