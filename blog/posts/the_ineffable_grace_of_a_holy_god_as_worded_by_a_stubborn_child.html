        <p>I pray these serve for such encouragement for those who read it, as it acts as a permanent reminder for me of the Lord’s mercies and loving kindness.</p>

        <h3>26th July 2021</h3>

        <p><b><i>1 John 3:4-10</i></b></p>

        <p><i>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.</i></p>

        <p>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. I pray for more grace, for greater brokenness and patience, and a repentant spirit to be set within this wretched heart of mine, that it may be regenerated to love the Lord. Dear Father, please rid me of complacence and pride in foolishly thinking myself better than those who cannot repent, when all I have experienced and do is by your hand of grace alone. May I be renewed each day by the knowledge that the son of God died for all my sins, and may that reminder bring me to my knees in submission to His will, as I serve Him as His humble servant for the rest of my days on this earth, until I meet Him again in eternity.</p> 

        <h3>27th July 2021</h3>

        <p>Lord guide my step that I might not stray from you</p>
        <p>My days on this earth are long and arduous, but I know they are still few</p>
        <p>All life is chaff, quickly blown into the wind, and all humanity is a flame, extinguished by a breeze</p>
        <p>So all I pray for as I wake each day</p>
        <p>Is that I may be closer to you</p>
        <p>And learn to love you more</p>
        
        <h3>31st July 2021</h3>

        <p>There is much at stake in this battle between the temptations of the flesh and the surpassing worth of the Lord I worship, but the greatest by far is that of my soul’s eternal damnation and the glory of God being defiled.</p>

        <p>Me, a Christian? If I live like the world, enjoy what the world enjoys, delight in constant and repeated sin of all manners, deceive myself into a pseudo-repentance when in actuality, there is none, then I am condemned and deserve every apportionment of the Holy Creator’s righteous wrath.</p>

        <p>The Lord has created all for His son, and all for His glory. By the father’s grace, He sent His perfect son down to die on the cross for sinful beings like you and I. Yet, even as the sovereign creator of all that is calls the cosmos, the stars, the mountains, the ocean, all the creatures that fly and swim and crawl the earth to worship Him, and they do in gladness, He calls to me “come, repent and be forgiven of your sin, I love you”, and I respond “No.”</p>

        <p>Who is man that God must show him grace? How worthless is my life and my being, how sinful, prideful, foolish, loud, perverse and obstinate am I in my ways! Yet above all, how great is my sin that condemns me to a fate worse than death, for I have committed the ultimate offence against the one who can destroy both my body, and my soul.</p>

        <p>Father, I am less than an ant or worm. I have no use and no purpose aside from being born to sin, and to die under your eternal wrath. Yet, by love, you sent your son to die for a wayward ingrate like me, that your perfect son would suffer your full wrath that was meant for me, for every sin I had ever and would ever commit, that before the only worthy judge, I would be made white as snow.</p>

        <p>I do not deserve this. I cannot understand why. Sometimes I don’t remember this gift is by grace and not by merit. Father, please discipline and break apart this child of yours, that he may be made aware of your great love for those you call your children. By this, may I praise you with every breath I have left on this earth, which you have given me, knowing my life is not mine to keep, that in every action and word I speak, I do it with an eye for eternity, and a heart for your name to be made known and to be praised, that you get all the glory.</p>

        <p>The Lord is great, and who can fathom His purposes? Truly, our God is in the heavens, He does all that he pleases.</p>

        <p>Soli Deo gloria.</p>
