# `XML`

Extensible Markup Language.

## Introduction

* XML files have the `.xml` file extension
* flexible text format for representing structured data
* allows definition of custom tags *(extremely similar to HTML)* and document structures
* designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable
* used for web services, configuration files, data interchange and storage

## Quickstart

Below is a sample XML file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<library>
    <book>
        <title>XML Developer's Guide</title>
        <author>Gambardella, Matthew</author>
        <genre>Computer</genre>
        <price>44.95</price>
        <pub_date>2000-10-01</pub_date>
        <description>An in-depth look at creating applications with XML.</description>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>Midnight Rain</title>
        <author>Ralls, Kim</author>
        <genre>Fantasy</genre>
        <price>5.95</price>
        <pub_date>2000-12-16</pub_date>
        <description>A former carpenter turned author is suddenly thrust into a world of magic.</description>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>Maeve Ascendant</title>
        <author>O'Brien, William</author>
        <genre>Science Fiction</genre>
        <price>29.95</price>
        <pub_date>2001-05-21</pub_date>
        <description>A high-stakes story about the race to control a powerful new technology.</description>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>The Hobbit</title>
        <author>Tolkien, J.R.R.</author>
        <genre>Fantasy</genre>
        <price>15.95</price>
        <pub_date>1937-09-21</pub_date>
        <description>Bilbo Baggins goes on an unexpected journey with a group of dwarves.</description>
    </book>
</library>
```

Here, 

* `<library>` is the **root element** containing all book entries
* `<book>` represents an individual book entry
* `<title>`, `<author>`, `<genre>`, `<price>`, `<pub_date>`, `<description>` are all **child elements** providing details about each book

XML entries can then be called from a variety of programming languages using XML Path Language *(XPath)*.

Below are some sample XPath expressions that can be used to call specific entries.

1. ALL book titles

```xml
/library/book/title
```

2. Author of the first book

```xml
/library/book[1]/author
```

3. ALL books with the genre *"Fantasy"*

```xml
/library/book[genre='Fantasy']
```

4. Price of the book titled *"Maeve Ascendant"*

```xml
/library/book[title='Maeve Ascendant']/price
```

5. Publication date of the last book

```xml
/library/book[last()]/pub_date
```

6. Description of the book with the highest price

```xml
/library/book[price = max(/library/book/price)]/description
```

7. ALL book elements

```xml
/library/book
```

8. Titles and authors of ALL books

```xml
/library/book/title | /library/book/author
```
