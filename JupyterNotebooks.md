# `Jupyter notebooks`

Learn and run Python anywhere.

## Introduction

* Jupyter notebooks end with the `.ipynb` file extension *(standing for interactive python notebook)*
* open-source web app for creating and sharing documents that contain Python code
* widely used in data science, academic research, and machine learning for exploring and visualizing data
* notebooks can be exported to various target outputs *(`.html`, `.pdf`, `.py`, etc.)*
* Jupyter also supports other programming languages through various kernels

## Installation

```console
$ pip install notebook # installs Jupyter notebook 
$ jupyter notebook # starts the notebook server locally
```

## Quickstart

Jupyter notebooks can run simple Python code snippets

```py
x = 10
y = 20
example_equation = x + y
example_name = "keshi"

print("testing out my Jupyter notebook!")
print(f"my name is {example_name} and i calculate the total sum of x and y to be {example_equation}")
```

and more complex Python scripts for data science and visualisation.

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# plot the data
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```
