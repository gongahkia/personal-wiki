# General overview

* The legal process puts multiple *protective mechanisms* in place to prevent **arbitrary exercise of power** *(such as a sole police officer/ victim)* in the process of an investigation.   
* Only those in **High Office** *(Attorney General)*

# Criminal Justice Process

1. Reporting of a crime
2. *Judge, Lawyer, everyone all shouts at each other*
3. Final disposition of the case against the accused for the commission of the offence *(send you go jail)*

# 2 Models of Criminal Justice

| Crime Control Model | Due Process Model |
| :---: | :---: |
| *The repression of criminal conduct is by far the most important function.* | *Primacy to an individual's rights as opposed to the rights of the community as a whole.* |

Singapore adopts a ***hybrid model*** that incorporates both.

# Jury trials vs Bench trials

<img src="https://www.blankmediagames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-judgement.jpg" align="right" height="200px"/>

1. Jury trials

    * *The Jury* makes findings of fact based on evidence, and they have to make their final decision **based on the law** *(ie. their decision cannot be purely subjective)*.
    * The Jury **does not** need to explain their decision. 

2. Bench trials

    * *Judges* provide the final verdict for a given case.
    * The judge **has to** explain their decision according to the law.

**Overseas**, there is greater skepticism towards those who hold power, due to... 

* an impression that it is the elite ruling class who rise to positions of power *(like a Judge)*, so **Jury trials** are preferred.
* This is moreso a *political issue* of power held by the state, as opposed to whether a Jury trial actually holds the Jury accountable.

> Singapore adopts a **Bench trial** model, though in the past, we have tested jury trials for a period *(they were shit)*.
