# `Actor model`

* Conceptual model for concurrent computation
* Proposed by Carl Hewitt in 1973 
* Widely used in distributed real-time systems

## Quickstart

### Actor

* Universal primitives of computation
* Independent entities that
    1. **Process messages**: *actors* process messages asynchronously 
        * **asynchronous communication**
            * senders do not need to wait for receivers to process the message *(asynchronous)*
            * other operations are not blocked when waiting for a message response)
        * **no shared state** 
            * there is NO shared memory between actors
            * actors ONLY communicate by sending messages to each other
        * **dynamic behaviour**
            * actors can change their behavior based on the messages they receive. For example, an actor might switch to a different state after handling a message, altering how it processes future messages.
    2. **Encapsulates state**: *actor* state is private (only modifiable by the *actor*)
    3. **Manages state**: *actors* can create new *actors*, send messages to other *actors* and respond to received messages
        * **create new actors**: allowing for scalable systems
        * **send messages**: possible if them sender actor knows the receiver actor's address
        * **specify behavior**: actors can DECIDE how to react to the next received message

## Benefits

* **Concurrency**: naturally supported since actors operate independently
* **Fault tolerance**: actors that supervise other actors (restarting them if they fail) can be designed
* **Scalability**: actors can be created on demand
* **Avoid deadlocks**: sidesteps issues created by traditional concurrency *(reliant on threads and locks)* with NO shared state and message-passing

## Usecases

Often used in  

* distributed systems where components must communicate reliably and operate concurrently
* real-time systems requiring responsiveness and robustness *(eg. telecom systems)*
