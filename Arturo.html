<h2>Printing</h2>
<pre><code class="language-art"># ----- COMMENT -----
    # print() =&gt; receives a string as an argument and prints it to the stdout, with the output not including a newline by default
    # println() =&gt; receives a string as an argument and prints it to the stdout, including a newline automatically at the end of the output

print(&quot;this does not have a newline and one must be explicitly specified to be included as here\n&quot;)
println(&quot;this includes a newline automatically&quot;)

<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<pre><code class="language-art"># ----- QUICKSTART -----
    # dynamically-typed with clean and expressive code 
    # supports further functional programming paradigms if desired
    # extensive interoperability with existing systems and frameworks
    # in fact, Arturo's syntax bears many similarities to Python, particularly in its simplicity and indentation-based scope
    # Arturo is suitable for the following and more
        # scripting and automation
        # data cleansing and analysis
        # web development through server-side logic
        # rapid prototyping 
        # introduction to programming
</code></pre>
<h2>Types</h2>
<pre><code class="language-art"># ----- TYPE -----
    # Integer =&gt; stores an integer number value
    # Float =&gt; stores a floating-point number value
    # String =&gt; stores a string value declared within &quot;&quot; double quotation marks, note that characters are handled as single-character long strings
    # Boolean =&gt; true, false
</code></pre>
<h2>Operators</h2>
<pre><code class="language-art"># ----- OPERATOR -----

# --- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ---

- # subtraction
* # multiplication
/ # division
% # modulo

# --- COMPARISON OPERATORS ---

== # complete equality check for both type and value
!= # complete inequality check for both type and value

<h2>Control structures</h2>
<pre><code class="language-art"># ----- CONTROL STRUCTURE -----

# --- CONDITIONALS ---

# IF ELIF ELSE

# MATCH CASE _
    # provides a degree of pattern-matching in Arturo, the equivalent of switch case in other programming languages
    # _ =&gt; specifies the default fall-through case within the match-case construct which runs when all other predicate case conditions have not been met

# --- LOOPS ---

# FOR IN 
    # operates exactly the same as in Python, the equivalent of foreach loops in PHP
    # enabling iteration and traversal of an iterable data structure

<h2>Data structures</h2>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<pre><code class="language-art"># ----- FUNCTION -----
    # def &lt;functionName&gt; ( &lt;functionParameterName(s)&gt; ): &lt;functionDefinitionBody&gt; =&gt; definition and declaration of a named function
