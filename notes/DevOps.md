# `DevOps`

Culture, practices, and tools that combine software development and IT operations to shorten development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

## Introduction

* **DevOps** bridges the gap between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) teams
* Emphasizes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility
* Focuses on automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery
* Aims to increase deployment frequency while maintaining stability and security
* Cultural shift toward shared ownership of the entire application lifecycle

## Core Principles

```
# ----- COLLABORATION -----
    # Break down silos between development and operations
    # Shared responsibility for application performance and reliability  
    # Cross-functional teams working toward common goals
    # Regular communication and feedback loops

# ----- AUTOMATION -----
    # Automate repetitive tasks to reduce human error
    # Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent environments
    # Automated testing throughout the pipeline
    # Automated deployment and rollback procedures

# ----- CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT -----
    # Iterative development and deployment processes
    # Regular retrospectives and process optimization
    # Monitoring and metrics-driven decisions
    # Learning from failures and near-misses

# ----- CUSTOMER-CENTRIC -----
    # Focus on delivering value to end users
    # Rapid feedback incorporation
    # Shorter time-to-market for features
    # Improved reliability and user experience
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

```
# ----- CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI) -----
    # Developers integrate code changes frequently (multiple times per day)
    # Automated builds triggered by code commits
    # Comprehensive test suites run automatically
    # Quick feedback on code quality and functionality

# TYPICAL CI WORKFLOW:
    # 1. Developer commits code to version control (Git)
    # 2. CI server detects change and triggers build
    # 3. Code is compiled and unit tests executed  
    # 4. Static code analysis and security scans
    # 5. Integration tests run in clean environment
    # 6. Build artifacts stored in artifact repository
    # 7. Notifications sent to team about build status

# ----- CONTINUOUS DELIVERY (CD) -----
    # Extension of CI that automates deployment to staging/production
    # Code always in deployable state after passing CI
    # Automated deployment pipelines with approval gates
    # Blue-green or canary deployment strategies

# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:
    # Blue-Green: Two identical environments, switch traffic instantly
    # Canary: Gradual rollout to subset of users/servers  
    # Rolling: Sequential update of servers in production
    # Feature Flags: Control feature visibility without deployment

# ----- PIPELINE TOOLS -----
    # Jenkins => open-source automation server with extensive plugins
    # GitLab CI => integrated with GitLab repositories
    # GitHub Actions => workflow automation directly in GitHub
    # Azure DevOps => Microsoft's comprehensive DevOps platform
    # CircleCI => cloud-native CI/CD platform
    # TeamCity => JetBrains' build management server
```

## Infrastructure as Code

```
# ----- INFRASTRUCTURE AUTOMATION -----
    # Define infrastructure using code rather than manual processes
    # Version-controlled infrastructure configurations
    # Consistent, repeatable environment provisioning
    # Reduces configuration drift and human errors

# ----- PROVISIONING TOOLS -----

# TERRAFORM
    # Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
    # Declarative configuration language (HCL)
    # State management for tracking infrastructure changes
    # Plan => preview changes before applying
    # Apply => create/modify infrastructure
    # Destroy => tear down infrastructure

# ANSIBLE
    # Agentless configuration management
    # YAML-based playbooks for automation tasks
    # Push model: control machine connects to targets
    # Idempotent operations: safe to run repeatedly
    # Supports infrastructure, configuration, and application deployment

# CLOUDFORMATION (AWS)
    # Native AWS infrastructure as code service
    # JSON/YAML templates define AWS resources

```

## Monitoring and Observability

```
# ----- THREE PILLARS OF OBSERVABILITY -----

# METRICS
    # Numerical measurements over time
    # System performance indicators (CPU, memory, disk)
    # Application metrics (response time, throughput, error rate)
    # Business metrics (user registrations, revenue)

# LOGS  
    # Structured or unstructured records of events
    # Application logs for debugging and auditing
    # System logs for infrastructure monitoring
    # Centralized log aggregation and analysis

# TRACES
    # Request flow through distributed systems
    # End-to-end visibility across microservices
    # Performance bottleneck identification
    # Distributed tracing correlation

# ----- MONITORING TOOLS -----

    # Grafana => visualization and dashboards
    # AlertManager => handles alerts from Prometheus
    # Service discovery and scraping configuration

# ELK/EFK STACK
