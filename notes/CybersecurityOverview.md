# `Cybersecurity Overview`

## Definitions

* Data lifecycle: stages that data goes through from creation to deletion or archiving *(generation, collection, processing, storage, management, analysis, visualization, interpretation)*
* Data integrity: assurance that data is accurate, complete, consistent and uncorrupted throughout its lifecycle
* Data confidentiality: ensuring data is protected from unauthorized access and disclosure
* Encryption: Conversion of readable information to an unreadable format using an algorithm and key, used to ensure data confidentiality
* Hashing: One-way mathematical function that irreversibly transforms data to a fixed-size character string, used to ensure data integrity
* Red team: Group that acts as malicious actors, simulating real-world attacks that identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an organization's defenses
* Blue team: Group that acts as the targetted organisation, defending their systems and networks against the Red team's attacks
* Purple team: Group that acts as both the Red and Blue team, improving an organisation's security posture with offensive and defensive measures
* Pentesting: A.K.A penetration testing, a simulated cyber attack by ethical hackers to evaluate an organisation's system vulnerabilities and security posture

### Phishing ðŸŽ£

Malicious actors trick individuals into revealing SENSITIVE information by impersonating as a trustworthy entity.

Specific variants include

1. SPEAR PHISHING: Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
2. WHALING: A type of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals like executives.
3. VISHING: Voice phishing conducted through phone calls.
4. SMISHI: Phishing via SMS messages.

### Malware ðŸ’»

Malicious software that harms devices or networks. 

Specific variants include

1. VIRUSES: Self-replicating programs that spread to other systems.
2. WORMS: Viruses that do not require human interaction to spread.
3. TROJAN HORSES: Malicious software disguised as legitimate applications.  
4. RANSOMWARE: Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.

### Denial of Service â›”

* A.K.A DoS. 
* Make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. 

Specific variants include

1. DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE: A.K.A DDoS. Uses multiple compromised systems to launch an attack.
2. APPLICATION LAYER ATTACKS: Targets specific applications to exploit vulnerabilities.

### Identity-Based attacks ðŸ§Ÿ

Stealing personal information to gain unauthorized access.

1. CREDENTIAL HARVESTING: Malicious actors collect login credentials en masse.
2. BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE: A.K.A BEC. Involves impersonating a trusted source to deceive customers or employees into transferring funds or data.

### Code Injection ðŸ’‰

Feeding programs malicious code to manipulate data and execute unauthorized commands.

1. SQL INJECTION: Inserting malicious SQL queries through input fields.
2. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: A.K.A XSS. Injecting scripts into web pages viewed by users.

### Man-in-the-Middle attacks ðŸ–•

* A.K.A MitM attacks.
* Malicious actors intercept and alter communication between two parties without their knowledge. 

Typically arises from 

1. ROGUE ACCESS POINTS mimicking legitimate networks, created by the malicious actors.
2. EAVESDROPPING on existing unsecured connections.

### Supply Chain attacks ðŸšš

* Exploit supply chain vulnerabilities.
* Can target both SOFTWARE and HARDWARE components.

## Securing data

The 2 main methods to secure data are [encryption](#encryption) and [hashing](#hashing).

### Overview 

**Encryption**

* Susceptible to COMPROMISED KEYS due to poor management
* Susceptible to WEAK ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS 
* Commonly used for data confidentiality IN TRANSIT (during communication) and AT REST (storage)

**Hashing**

* Susceptible to COLLISION ATTACKS where different data inputs produce the same hash value
* Susceptible to BRUTE-FORCE ATTACKS if weak hash functions are used
* Commonly used for data integrity checks

### Encryption

> [!TIP]  
> Remember to run `pip install pycryptodome` to run the worked examples below.

#### Symmetric Encryption

* Relies on ONE key for encryption and decryption
* Sender and receiver must both have the key 
* Typically fast
* More efficient for encrypting large volumes of data 
* Requires secure key management 
* Used to protect data from being read by unwanted actors
* REVERSIBLE since encryption is a TWO-WAY process

```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Asymmetric Encryption

* Relies on TWO keys
    * PUBLIC key for encryption
    * PRIVATE key for decryption
* Sender has their own public and private key pair
    * encrypts messages with the RECEIVER's public key
    * decryptes messages with their private key
* Receiver has their own public and private key pair
    * decrypts messages with their private key
    * encrypts messages with the SENDER's public key
* Each party's PUBLIC keys are made known to the other, their PRIVATE keys are kept secret
* Typically slower than symmetric encryption
* More secure for encrypting small volumes of data
* Allows secure communication without sharing private key
* Used to protect data from being read by unwanted actors
* REVERSIBLE since encryption is a TWO-WAY process

```

</td>
</tr>

### Hashing

* Relies on HASH functions to map input data to a fixed-size hash value (message digest)
* Sender and receiver must BOTH ensure data integrity by computing and comparing the hash values based off their data
* Data is intact if hash values MATCH
* Typically faster than both symmetric and asymmetric encryption
* Requires collision management since hash functions can produce the SAME hash value for different inputs
* Used to verify if data has been altered during transit
* IRREVERSIBLE since hashing is a ONE-WAY function
