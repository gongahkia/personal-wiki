# `Logic`

Foundations of logic.

## Definitions

* Formal logic
    * [deductive reasoning](#more-on)
    * bound by structured argumentation with defined rules *(e.g [syllogisms](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/syllogism), [symbolic logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/symbolic%20logic))*
    * can be represented in [mathematical form](#more-on)
    * used in philosophy, mathematics and computer science
* Informal logic
    * [inductive reasoning](#more-on)
    * prone to [logical fallacies](#more-on)
    * not bound by strict formal structure 
    * used in debates, legal arguments and everyday reasoning  

## Symbolic logic 

A branch of formal logic.

1. Conjunction 
    1. AND
    2. True if and only if **both operands are True**
    3. symbol: `∧`
  
2. Disjunction 
    1. OR
    2. True if **at least one operand is True, including both**
    3. symbol: `∨`

3. Exclusive Disjunction
    1. XOR
    2. True if **one operand is true, but not both**
    3. symbol: `⊕`

4. Negation
    1. NOT
    2. **Inverts the truth value** of the operand
    3. symbol: `¬`

5. Implication
    1. IF ... THEN ...
    2. True **unless a true statement implies a false one**
    3. symbol: `→`

6. Coimplication 
    1. IF AND ONLY IF 
    2. Biconditional, True if **both operands have the same truth value**
    3. symbol: `↔`

### Truth table

Proposition: *A and B are truth values.*

| Scenario | A   | B   | ¬A  | A ∧ B | A ∨ B | A ⊕ B | A → B | A ↔ B |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| #1 | T   | T   | F   | T     | T     | F     | T     | T     |
| #2 | T   | F   | F   | F     | T     | T     | F     | F     |
| #3 | F   | T   | T   | F     | T     | T     | T     | F     |
| #4 | F   | F   | T   | F     | F     | F     | T     | T     |
