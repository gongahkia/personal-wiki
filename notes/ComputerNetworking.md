# `Computer networking`

The practice of connecting computing devices to share resources and communicate across local and wide area networks.

## Introduction

* **Computer networking** enables communication between computing devices
* Fundamental to modern computing: internet, cloud services, distributed systems
* Involves hardware (routers, switches, cables) and software (protocols, applications)
* Spans from local connections to global internet infrastructure
* Enables resource sharing, data exchange, and collaborative computing

## Network Models

```
# ----- OSI MODEL (7 LAYERS) -----
    # Conceptual framework for understanding network communication
    # Each layer provides services to the layer above
    # Abstraction allows independent development of layer technologies

# LAYER 7: APPLICATION
    # User interface to network services
    # HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH protocols
    # Web browsers, email clients, file transfer applications

# LAYER 6: PRESENTATION  
    # Data formatting, encryption, compression
    # SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG, PNG, ASCII encoding
    # Character sets, data representation

# LAYER 5: SESSION
    # Establishes, manages, terminates connections
    # Session management, authentication, authorization  
    # NetBIOS, RPC, SQL sessions

# LAYER 4: TRANSPORT
    # End-to-end data delivery and error recovery
    # TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable) protocols
    # Port numbers, flow control, error detection

# LAYER 3: NETWORK
    # Routing between different networks
    # IP addressing, packet forwarding, path determination
    # IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, routing protocols (OSPF, BGP)

# LAYER 2: DATA LINK
    # Node-to-node delivery within same network segment
    # Frame formatting, error detection, MAC addressing
    # Ethernet, Wi-Fi, switches, bridges

# LAYER 1: PHYSICAL
    # Transmission of raw bits over physical medium
    # Cables, wireless signals, voltage levels, timing
    # Hubs, repeaters, network interface cards

# ----- TCP/IP MODEL (4 LAYERS) -----
    # Practical model used in internet implementation
    # Application => combines OSI layers 5-7
    # Transport => corresponds to OSI layer 4  
    # Internet => corresponds to OSI layer 3
    # Network Access => combines OSI layers 1-2
```

## Internet Protocol Suite

```
# ----- IP ADDRESSING -----

# IPv4 (32-BIT ADDRESSES)
    # Dotted decimal notation: 192.168.1.1
    # ~4.3 billion unique addresses (exhausted)
    # Classes: A (0.0.0.0-127.255.255.255), B, C
    # Private ranges: 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 192.168.x.x
    # CIDR notation: 192.168.1.0/24 (subnet mask)

# ----- TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS -----

# TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL)
    # Connection-oriented, reliable delivery
    # Three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
    # Flow control, congestion control, error recovery
    # Sequence numbers ensure ordered delivery
    # Used by HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, email protocols

# UDP (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)  
    # Connectionless, unreliable delivery
    # Lower overhead, faster transmission
    # No error recovery or flow control
    # Best-effort delivery with possible packet loss
    # Used by DNS, DHCP, streaming media, gaming

# ----- APPLICATION PROTOCOLS -----

# HTTP/HTTPS (WEB TRAFFIC)
    # HTTP => Hypertext Transfer Protocol (port 80)
    # HTTPS => HTTP over SSL/TLS (port 443)  
    # Request-response model: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    # Status codes: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error

# DNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)
    # Translates domain names to IP addresses
    # Hierarchical distributed database
    # Root servers, TLD servers, authoritative servers
    # Query types: A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), MX (mail), CNAME (alias)

# FTP (FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL)
    # Transfers files between client and server
    # Control connection (port 21) and data connection
    # Active vs passive modes for data transfer
    # SFTP and FTPS for secure file transfer

    # Learns MAC addresses and forwards frames intelligently
    # Each port is separate collision domain (full-duplex)
    # VLAN support for network segmentation
    # Spanning Tree Protocol prevents loops

# ROUTER (NETWORK LAYER)
    # Forwards packets between different networks
    # Maintains routing tables with path information
    # NAT (Network Address Translation) for private networks

# STATEFUL FIREWALLS
    # Track connection state (TCP handshake status)
    # Make decisions based on connection context
    # More secure than packet filtering
    # Can detect connection hijacking attempts

# APPLICATION LAYER FIREWALLS

    # Attacker intercepts communication between parties
    # ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi hotspots
    # Prevention: encryption, certificate validation

# DDoS (DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE)
    # Overwhelming target with traffic from multiple sources
    # Volume attacks (UDP floods), protocol attacks (SYN flood)
    # Application layer attacks (HTTP floods)
    # Mitigation: rate limiting, traffic filtering, CDNs

# NETWORK SCANNING
    # Port scanning to find open services
    # Network reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery
    # Nmap tool for network discovery and security auditing
    # Defense: intrusion detection systems, port filtering

    # Secure communication over insecure networks
    # Public key cryptography for key exchange
    # Symmetric encryption for data transfer
    # Certificate authorities validate server identity

# VPN (VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK)
    # Secure tunnel over public networks
