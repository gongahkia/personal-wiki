Written by an individual who [climbs](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/), [runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running) and occasionally does [calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics).

Mainly focusing on [Creatine](#creatine), [Multivitamins](#multivitamins) and [Protein](#protein).

## TLDR

In order, take the following.

1. 20-40g [protein](#protein) *immediately* post-exercise 
2. 1-5g [Creatine](#creatine) *daily* with or post-protein
3. [Multivitamin](#multivitamins) *daily* with food

## Creatine

Micro-dose of 1–5g daily alongside a carbohydrate or protien-rich meal for absorption maxxing.

### Recovery

* Faster ATP regeneration
    * **ATP regeneration**: main energy source for muscles for intense short bursts of physical effort
* Faster glycogen replenishment
    * **Glycogen**: 
* Reduced muscle soreness 
* Mitigate muscle damage

### Performance 

* Increased muscle strength and explosive power 
* Increase in power endurance 

## Multivitamins

Take a well-formulated multivitamin daily with food for better absorption. Better Mutivitamins include vitamin B, C, D, E, Zinc, Magnesium and Calcium

### Recovery

* Improve enegry metabolism with B vitamins 
    * **B vitamins**: Convert food into energy during exercise
* Recovery vitamins help muscle and tissue repair 
    * **Recovery vitamins**: Vitamins C, D, E and minerals like Zinc and Magnesium
* Fill nutritional gaps during high training loads

### Performance

* Magensium prevents cramping 
* Calcium and Vitamin D enhances bone strength
* Vitamn C, Zinc and Magnesium reduce inflammation

## Protein

Eat 20–40g of high-quality protein within 30-60 minutes of completing strenous exercise. Daily protein intake should be 0.8g per Kg of body weight.

### Recovery

* Muscle repair and growth
* Preserve lean muscle mass during higher training loads
